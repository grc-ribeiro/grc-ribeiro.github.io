<h1>Presentation poster  </h1>

<p>As part of the final deliverables for the class you need to design a 24×36″ poster. </p>

<p>It’s not, however a commercial poster. Your product doesn’t exist for purchase, download, or even for testing. But it does exist in the context of a concept product that you’ve designed. </p>

<p>Therefore your audience is not some fake potential consumers that would potentially buy it. Your audience is very real. It can be someone judging your product for a design student exhibition. It can be someone visiting such exhibition. It’s someone walking down the hallway of the building. What do they need to know about the product that you’ve designed? Think of your poster as a description of your product. It’s your report minus process.</p>

<p>Tell the story of how it improves one’s experience around the domain you’re working&nbsp;on. Show it honestly and compelling. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that a 24×36″ is not a big version of a 8×12″. A 24×36″ poster allow for different levels of readings. There’s the 10-foot, the 3-foot, and the 1-foot readings. There’s room for plenty of information without visual clutter on your layout.  </p>

<p>There’s no template for the poster, but you should design it appropriately and you should follow some basic rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>24×36″ means vertical (portrait) format.</strong> <br />
Horizontal posters will receive an automatic F grade.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Print it in matte paper.</strong> <br />
Posters printed in glossy paper will receive an automatic F grade.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audience</strong> <br />
Your audience for the poster is similar to the audience of your report. You’re not selling your product to your final consumer. It’s more of a scientific poster, where you explain the strengths of your product and what problems it solves.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Images</strong> <br />
Include images to help communicate the subject matter of your product.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Screens</strong> <br />
You want to include screens of the digital user interface. You won’t include all screens of your product, nor will it be as comprehensive as the screens on your report. But you should include as many screens as necessary to communicate the main functionalities of your product.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>No third-party logos</strong> <br />
Again, it’s not a fake commercial poster. Don’t include atrocities such as <em>App&nbsp;Store</em> and&nbsp;<em>Google&nbsp;Play</em>&nbsp;logos.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>No fake URL</strong> <br />
If you have a URL where we can learn more about the project, please include it. If you don’t have a real URL, don’t include a fake commercial URL. Once again, <strong>this is not a fake commercial poster</strong>.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>No fake praise or slogans either</strong> <br />
Did I mention anything about it not being a fake commercial poster?  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include your names</strong> <br />
The names of the students in the group should be in the poster, with type size 10pts, on a vertical baseline, ¼ inch from the right margin. Use the convention <strong>Firstname Lastname, Firstname Lastname</strong>. You don’t need to write the word “by” in front of the names or anything but a comma to separate them. (No “and” or “&amp;”.) Do not stack letters (ever in your life, actually). <a href="images/names-on-the-posters.jpg">Click here for a visual example on how to include your names on the poster</a>.  </p></li>
</ol>
