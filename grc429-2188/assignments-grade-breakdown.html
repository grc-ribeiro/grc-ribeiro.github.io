<h1>Grade breakdown  </h1>

<h3>Project documentation: 60%</h3>

<p>Every week—from week 2 to finals week— you will be required to bring an updated version of&nbsp;your report. On finals week, you will also deliver a final presentation on the day of our finals. Those are the only assignments for this class. Your report will be graded weekly, and in each week the grade will receive a greater weight. In the second week, it will weigh 2; in the third week, it will weight 3, and so on, until finals week, when your final presentation will weight 12.</p>

<h3>Exams: 30%</h3>

<p>Midterm exam: 40% <br />
Final exam: 60%</p>

<h3>Class journal: 10%</h3>

<p>At the end of every week of class, you need to write a brief journal entry on PolyLearn. It&nbsp;should not take you more than five minutes, though.</p>
