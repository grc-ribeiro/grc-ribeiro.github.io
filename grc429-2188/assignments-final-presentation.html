<h1>Final presentation  </h1>

<p>Design a&nbsp;presentation to&nbsp;teach us about your product.</p>

<p>You want to tell a&nbsp;story of what people can do with your app. What does it do? How does it do it? Why is it different? Also, include your process, personas, ethical consideration, future enhancements, etc.</p>

<p>You want to present it as if you were in a job interview with a potential employer. (Rather than a presentation to a fictional consumer or&nbsp;user of your product.)</p>

<p>You may&nbsp;have as&nbsp;many slides as&nbsp;you need, but&nbsp;you will have 10&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;present either on December&nbsp;3rd or&nbsp;December&nbsp;6th, during lab. </p>

<p>Save your presentation as&nbsp;a 16×9 ratio (e.g. 1920×1080 pixels), landscape, multi-page&nbsp;PDF. (You may present it from whatever software you choose, though.)</p>
