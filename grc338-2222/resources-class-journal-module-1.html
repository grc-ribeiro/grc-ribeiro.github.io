<h1>Class journal, module 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s nice of&nbsp;you to&nbsp;talk about being stressed and&nbsp;in school. Health always comes first and&nbsp;we should get&nbsp;sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Being frustrated about learning new&nbsp;topics is&nbsp;normal. However, being frustrated for&nbsp;a long time over an&nbsp;assignment or&nbsp;problem is&nbsp;not productive. If&nbsp;we are&nbsp;frustrated or&nbsp;confused at&nbsp;any point of&nbsp;the course with assignments or&nbsp;other tasks, Bruno trusts us&nbsp;to contact him&nbsp;for&nbsp;clarification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m a&nbsp;little bit&nbsp;nervous for&nbsp;this class because I&nbsp;have always found coding to&nbsp;be really difficult and&nbsp;confusing. Even the&nbsp;first little assignment we&nbsp;did in&nbsp;lab this week was&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;hard for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;am excited to&nbsp;learn about it, though!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’re all here to help you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>As students, we&nbsp;might not&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;see exactly how&nbsp;the activities apply right away, but&nbsp;knowing that Bruno has&nbsp;prepared them with purpose and&nbsp;intention makes me&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;figure them&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">But if you can’t figure it out, please ask me.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I loved meeting everybody in&nbsp;the lab&nbsp;today!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The one thing I missed the most during fully online was students’ collaboration.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There is&nbsp;no proven validity to&nbsp;someones learning styles actually helping them&nbsp;learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Very true.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You will not&nbsp;get very far&nbsp;as a&nbsp;designer without the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;take criticism and&nbsp;use it&nbsp;for growth or&nbsp;improving your&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Somebody’s been reading the readings on the class website.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>A website I&nbsp;really enjoyed at&nbsp;my previous school when we&nbsp;learned HTML coding was: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp</a>. This site breaks down topics very well and makes it easy to follow. I plan on referencing it during this class because I enjoy teaching myself topics then going to Bruno if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Sydney! Trying to teach yourself is way more effective for learning than me telling you. Also helpful to ask for help to your peers. And if it all fails, I can help too. W3Schools is awesome. I use it all the time. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN</a> is also extremely helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found this link talking about some ways to&nbsp;create visual hierarchy which is&nbsp;pretty interesting and&nbsp;helpful! <https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/information-architecture/visual-hierarchy-principles-examples/</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Abby!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>If you&nbsp;can host your website through GitHub for&nbsp;free, how&nbsp;does buying a&nbsp;domain name work, and&nbsp;does that cost&nbsp;money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It does cost money, but it’s cheaper than you’d think, about $8 to $20 a year.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Coding is&nbsp;very sensitive: I&nbsp;accidentally typed a&nbsp;random slash (/) while transferring the&nbsp;code into GitHub during the&nbsp;hello world assignment and&nbsp;my website did&nbsp;not work until the&nbsp;error was&nbsp;located and&nbsp;fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sensitive is one way to see it. You’re not wrong.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Curious about why&nbsp;certain elements are&nbsp;required in&nbsp;the code and&nbsp;their purpose. It&nbsp;was easy enough to&nbsp;copy code but&nbsp;what about fixing small mistakes or&nbsp;making changes to&nbsp;the content&nbsp;itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You copied and first just for the fist assignment. Next time, you’ll write everything by hand and you’ll understand what you’re typing.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;curious to&nbsp;learn more about how&nbsp;the page we&nbsp;published was&nbsp;created, and&nbsp;learn the&nbsp;inner workings rather than just copy and&nbsp;pasting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You will. That was just for the Hello World assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that in&nbsp;order for&nbsp;the site to&nbsp;be viewable, I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;include all&nbsp;the folders as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the actual file in&nbsp;the&nbsp;URL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not necessarily. If your file is named <code>index.html</code>, it’s visible when you link to its top folder. So, <strong><em>username</em>.github.io/grc338/helloworld</strong> actually works. (Try it with your own username.) The reason we included the file name in the end was a work around against GitHub’s agressive caching.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>To prepare me&nbsp;for the&nbsp;coding portion of&nbsp;this class, I&nbsp;will most likely listen to&nbsp;some instructional coding videos (like those on&nbsp;Khan Academy or&nbsp;LinkedIn Learning).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Those are indeed very good resources, but I hope my own videos are sufficient for the next labs.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When creating a&nbsp;file on&nbsp;GitHub, forward slashes communicate you’re creating a&nbsp;folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;learn how&nbsp;to incorporate javascript with HTML/CSS down the&nbsp;line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not with me, though.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JavaScript has a certain beauty to it. Like shiny, clear, broken glass. On a cold toilet seat. In winter.</p>&mdash; Andy Hunt (@PragmaticAndy) <a href="https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy/status/345203644888674304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">June 13, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Other students have told me&nbsp;great things about this class and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am looking forward to&nbsp;learning a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;really useful&nbsp;concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I too am looking forward to working with all of you.</p>
