<h1>CSS style  </h1>

<p>Download <a href="lasagna-recipe-files.zip">this zip file</a>. It contains one HTML file, one image, and one CSS file. Your job is to style the webpage to the best if your abilites. Think about some of the design principles we talked about (e.g. concistency, color, highliting, legibility, etc.) and make the page as interesting as possible. I have started the CSS with very few lines; feel free to use them or not. </p>

<p>I also included a placeholder image. You need to replace it with an appropriate image. Whatever you do, though, you may not edit the HTML file at all.</p>

<p><strong>Do not change the HTML file for any reason! Not one bit!!!</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, I may have overdone it with divs and classes. Don&rsquo;t feel like you need to style every single class I used in my HTML file. You may choose to ignore some of them if you think it&rsquo;s the most appropriate.</p>

<p>For this assignment, the goal is to make it look good on laptops and desktops. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about mobile devices too much.</p>

<p>Beyond your technical skills on the HTML and CSS files, you will be evaluated on your capacity to create a solution that is visually interesting and appropriate for the content.</p>

<p>As usual, make sure to <a href="resources-be-creative-on-your-mistakes.html">avoid the most common mistakes</a></p>

<p>Publish your pages on the URL: <strong><em>username</em>.github.io/grc338/lasagna</strong>  </p>

<p>Click on <a href="links-2-html-3-css-style.html">your name</a> to check if it&rsquo;s working.</p>
