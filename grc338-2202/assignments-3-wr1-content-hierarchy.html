<h1>Website redesign: content hierarchy  </h1>

<p>Based on the design principles we have studied, find a website, with between four and six pages, that you would consider a <strong>very bad example of design</strong>. </p>

<p>Propose a new design for <strong>all pages</strong> of that website. You may also rethink its structure, removing, adding, or combining pages.</p>

<p>Use tentative final content. (Do <strong>not</strong> use placeholder content for your text.)</p>

<p>Do not use PDFs or images as content either. (If you&rsquo;re redesigning a restaurant&rsquo;s website, and the menu is too long, you can edit it down.)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to include a navigation menu with links to all pages. You want to write your menu as a list. (Also, you may be tempted not to include a link from a page to itself, but it&rsquo;s not a good idea.)</p>

<p>You have some <em>temporary</em> strict restrictions, though:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can&rsquo;t use style. For this assignment, you will make sure to structure the documents with the appropriate tags and the classes you find necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s probably a good idea to link all of your pages to a single CSS file, so you don&rsquo;t have to do it later. However, you may include only one line in your CSS for now: <code>img {width: 100%; }</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the logo of the company with <strong>an image</strong> of their name in Helvetica Regular and the color black.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you&rsquo;re done, you can either find nice images or use place holders.</p>

<p>Example: Use the image on the right as a replacement for the one on the left.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="../images/wireframe-example-boat.png" alt="Wireframe example with boats" title="" /></p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll be able to use nice images, colors, and typefaces later.)  </p>

<p>For now, <strong>you will be evaluated on your HTML skills as well as on your hierarchy and semantic choices</strong>.</p>
