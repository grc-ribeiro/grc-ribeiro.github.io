<h1>Website redesign: mobile first  </h1>

<p>Using your HTML files from last assignment, style your website using <strong>one single CSS file</strong>, making sure it looks appropriate on a <strong>smartphone</strong>. (You don&rsquo;t need to worry about other screen sizes for now; it&rsquo;s for smartphone sizes only.)  </p>

<p>Use final content, colors, images, style, etc. But <strong>keep it simple</strong>.</p>

<p>Beyond your technical skills on the HTML and CSS files, you will be evaluated on your capacity to <strong>apply the design principles that we have discussed in class to your work</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start by reading my feedback from previous assignments, so you don&rsquo;t make the same mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very economical and <a href="assignments-3-wr-css-restrictions.html">follow these CSS restrictions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to reuse classes for consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to use appropriate, semantic tags and class names.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to use appropriate, semantic property values.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t forget to test in different phone sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to avoid the the simple mistakes. Each mistake from the list of <a href="resources-be-creative-on-your-mistakes.html">simple mistakes to avoid</a> will be a 20&#8209;point penalty. Three or more mistakes is an <strong>automatic zero</strong>, with no further comments. It&rsquo;s easy to avoid them all, though.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(You may want to redesign the logo of the company, but keep it <em>very</em> simple. I&rsquo;d&nbsp;suggest its name on a nice typeface and one color. This is not a class on logo design; you won&rsquo;t be evaluated on the originality and effectiveness of the logo. Just make sure it won&rsquo;t be a distraction to your web design work.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<h3>Design principles</h3>

<ul>
<li><h2>Aesthetic&#8209;usability effect; Form follows function; Expectation effect  </h2>

<p>Were aesthetic decisions on&nbsp;the website guided by&nbsp;the appropriate language for&nbsp;the business it&rsquo;s representing and&nbsp;its&nbsp;functionalities? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Alignment; Hierarchy  </h2>

<p>Does the&nbsp;placement of&nbsp;elements create a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;unity and&nbsp;cohesion, contributing to&nbsp;the design&rsquo;s overall aesthetic and&nbsp;perceived stability? Does&nbsp;the&nbsp;alignment of&nbsp;elements correctly lead the&nbsp;user through the&nbsp;page? Does&nbsp;the&nbsp;visual hierarchy represent the&nbsp;content&nbsp;hierarchy? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Entry point; Visibility  </h2>

<p>Does the&nbsp;home page conveys its&nbsp;job as&nbsp;the initial point of&nbsp;the website? Does it&nbsp;promote additional interaction? Are&nbsp;the main information and&nbsp;functionalities on&nbsp;each page clearly visible to&nbsp;the&nbsp;user? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Color; Highlighting; Von Restorff effect  </h2>

<p>Is color being used effectively to direct users to attract attention, group elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics? I&rsquo;d suggest using tools such as&nbsp; <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Adobe&nbsp;Color&nbsp;CC</a> to achieve a harmonic color palette. <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Consistency; Similarity  </h2>

<p>Are similar parts related? Are related parts similar? Are the variations consistently applied in all parts of the website? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Picture superiority effect; Face&#8209;ism ratio  </h2>

<p>Are images being used to&nbsp;complement the&nbsp;information on&nbsp;the website? If&nbsp;you have images of&nbsp;people, is&nbsp;the appropriate face&#8209;ism ratio being respected in&nbsp;all&nbsp;images? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Proximity; Horror vacui  </h2>

<p>Are related elements close together? Are&nbsp;close elements related? Are&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;blank space on&nbsp;the pages appropriate for&nbsp;the business the&nbsp;website&nbsp;represents? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Legibility; Chunking  </h2>

<p>Is the text legible? Does the text have appropriate size, typeface, contrast, line&#8209;length, and&nbsp;spacing? Is&nbsp;the&nbsp;information broken into appropriate chunks, so it is easier to process and remember? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Mental model; Wayfinding; Iconic&nbsp;representation; Fitts&rsquo;s&nbsp;law, Serial&nbsp;position&nbsp;effects  </h2>

<p>Is the&nbsp;layout consistent with users&rsquo; expectations? Can&nbsp;users easily navigate through the&nbsp;pages of&nbsp;the website? Are&nbsp;the buttons easily understandable? Do&nbsp;the links follow a&nbsp;logical order? Are&nbsp;the buttons easily selectable, even if users are using their fingers on a touch screen rather than a&nbsp;mouse? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Hick&rsquo;s law; Progressive disclosure  </h2>

<p>Are the possibilities of interaction limited to an appropriate number at each page? If there are too many options, are they broken into easily identifiable divisions in the page? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; <br />
Other principles, such as <strong>Recognition&nbsp;over&nbsp;recall</strong>, <strong>Errors</strong>, <strong>Forgiveness</strong>, and&nbsp;especially <strong>Accessibility</strong> must be taken in&nbsp;consideration, but they are covered by other principles and/or by the HTML/CSS part of the evaluation.</p>

<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>

<p>20&#8209;point penalty for mistake in the list of mistakes to avoid. Three or more mistakes is an <strong>automatic zero</strong>, with no further comments.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done, use tools such as <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html">FreeFormatter</a>, <a href="https://htmlformatter.com/">HTML&nbsp;Formatter</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer/">Code&nbsp;Beautify</a> to organize your HTML and CSS code.</p>

<p>Publish your website on the URL <br />
