<h1>Final website  </h1>

<p>Based on your proposal, design <strong>all pages</strong> of your website using <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>. (Free trial, no credit card required.)</p>

<p>Pick a template and customize it to your needs and preferences. Use <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206545567&#8209;Using&#8209;the&#8209;CSS&#8209;Editor">custom CSS</a> if necessary.</p>

<p>Use tentative final content. (Do <strong>not</strong> any placeholder content on your website.)</p>

<p>Make sure to include images that support the content and the aesthetics of your website.</p>

<p>(You may want to design a logo for your company, but keep it <em>very</em> simple. I&rsquo;d&nbsp;suggest its name on a nice typeface and one color. You won&rsquo;t be evaluated on the originality and effectiveness of the logo. This is not a class on logo design. Just make sure it won&rsquo;t be a distraction to your web design work.)</p>

<p>Beyond your technical skills on the HTML and CSS files, you will be evaluated on your capacity to <strong>apply the design principles that we have discussed in class to your work</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place a <a href="resources-redirect-file.html">file redirecting</a> to your website on the URL: <br />
<strong><em>username</em>.github.io/grc338/final</strong></p>

<p>Click on <a href="links-4-fp2-final.html">your name</a> to check if it&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>Squarespace won&rsquo;t let you make it public, but you can make it password protected. Please make the password <code>grc338</code>.</p>

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<h3>Design principles</h3>

<ul>
<li><h2>Aesthetic&#8209;usability effect; Form follows function; Expectation effect  </h2>

<p>Were aesthetic decisions on&nbsp;the website guided by&nbsp;the appropriate language for&nbsp;the business it&rsquo;s representing and&nbsp;its&nbsp;functionalities? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Alignment; Hierarchy  </h2>

<p>Does the&nbsp;placement of&nbsp;elements create a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;unity and&nbsp;cohesion, contributing to&nbsp;the design&rsquo;s overall aesthetic and&nbsp;perceived stability? Does&nbsp;the&nbsp;alignment of&nbsp;elements correctly lead the&nbsp;user through the&nbsp;page? Does&nbsp;the&nbsp;visual hierarchy represent the&nbsp;content&nbsp;hierarchy? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Entry point; Visibility  </h2>

<p>Does the&nbsp;home page conveys its&nbsp;job as&nbsp;the initial point of&nbsp;the website? Does it&nbsp;promote additional interaction? Are&nbsp;the main information and&nbsp;functionalities on&nbsp;each page clearly visible to&nbsp;the&nbsp;user? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Color; Highlighting; Von Restorff effect  </h2>

<p>Is color being used effectively to direct users to attract attention, group elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics? I&rsquo;d suggest using tools such as&nbsp; [Adobe&nbsp;Color&nbsp;CC][adcc] to achieve a harmonic color palette. <br />
<strong>10 points</strong>  </p></li>
<li><h2>Consistency; Similarity  </h2>

<p>Are similar parts related? Are related parts similar? Are the variations consistently applied in all parts of the website? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Picture superiority effect; Face&#8209;ism ratio  </h2>

<p>Are images being used to&nbsp;complement the&nbsp;information on&nbsp;the website? If&nbsp;you have images of&nbsp;people, is&nbsp;the appropriate face&#8209;ism ratio being respected in&nbsp;all&nbsp;images? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Proximity; Horror vacui  </h2>

<p>Are related elements close together? Are&nbsp;close elements related? Are&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;blank space on&nbsp;the pages appropriate for&nbsp;the business the&nbsp;website&nbsp;represents? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Legibility; Chunking  </h2>

<p>Is the text legible? Does the text have appropriate size, typeface, contrast, line&#8209;length, and&nbsp;spacing? Is&nbsp;the&nbsp;information broken into appropriate chunks, so it is easier to process and remember? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Mental model; Wayfinding; Iconic&nbsp;representation; Fitts&rsquo;s&nbsp;law, Serial&nbsp;position&nbsp;effects  </h2>

<p>Is the&nbsp;layout consistent with users&rsquo; expectations? Can&nbsp;users easily navigate through the&nbsp;pages of&nbsp;the website? Are&nbsp;the buttons easily understandable? Do&nbsp;the links follow a&nbsp;logical order? Are&nbsp;the buttons easily selectable, even if users are using their fingers on a touch screen rather than a&nbsp;mouse? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
<li><h2>Hick&rsquo;s law; Progressive disclosure  </h2>

<p>Are the possibilities of interaction limited to an appropriate number at each page? If there are too many options, are they broken into easily identifiable divisions in the page? <br />
<strong>10 points</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; <br />
Other principles, such as <strong>Recognition&nbsp;over&nbsp;recall</strong>, <strong>Errors</strong>, <strong>Forgiveness</strong>, and&nbsp;especially <strong>Accessibility</strong> must be taken in&nbsp;consideration, but they are covered by other principles and/or by the HTML/CSS part of the evaluation.</p>
