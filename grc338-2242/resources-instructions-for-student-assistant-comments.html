<p>Reminder: use gender neutral language when leaving comments! (i.e. they/them/their)</p>

<p>Estimated time: 2–3 hours</p>

<h3>Grading criteria: HTML</h3>

<p><code>body</code> (all the visible content needs to be in the body of the document)</p>

<p><code>finaltags</code> (didn’t close the final tags, body and/or html)</p>

<p><code>head</code> (no head in the document)</p>

<p><code>hrr</code> (Hierarchy is off.)*</p>

<p><code>listitems</code> (only list items can be inside lists)</p>

<p><code>lists</code> (list items need to be nested inside lists)</p>

<p><code>ul</code> (you, don’t need a new list for every list item)</p>

<p><code>org</code> (Code is not organized, no need to include line numbers)</p>

<p><code>title</code> (Didn’t include an appropriate title)</p>

<p><code>gw</code> (Good work, no comments, no need to include line numbers)</p>

<ul>
<li>You may need to include further explanation. Make two slashes (//) and write the comment to me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    Alex Doe

    org

    4 body

    7–9 hrr // made h2 where it should be h1 and vice-versa

    86 finaltags

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    Sam Smith

    gw

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning that…</p>

<p>Alex’s code was not very organized; </p>

<p>in the line <code>4</code> of their document, they had visible elements in the head rather than the body;</p>

<p>In lines <code>7</code> to <code>9</code>, the hierarchy was off, because they used <code>h1</code> where it should be <code>h2</code> and vice-versa;</p>

<p>they forgot to include the closing <code>body</code> and <code>html</code> tags in the end of the document.</p>

<p>While Sam’s work was flawless.</p>
