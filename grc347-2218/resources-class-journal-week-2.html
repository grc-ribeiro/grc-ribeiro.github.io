<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;2  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;be working with groups, it&nbsp;was fun&nbsp;to see&nbsp;other people building their brand voice and&nbsp;to help them find the&nbsp;words that describe their brand. I&nbsp;wish we&nbsp;met more often for&nbsp;this class, it&nbsp;feels disjointed coming in&nbsp;only once a&nbsp;week. I&nbsp;miss the&nbsp;shortened schedule from summer school with 339, but&nbsp;maybe that will change as&nbsp;the quarter goes on&nbsp;and my&nbsp;workload&nbsp;increases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">For these first weeks, I&nbsp;understand why&nbsp;it feels like this, since there isn’t much homework. But&nbsp;Once you&nbsp;start designing your package, you&nbsp;may need more time between&nbsp;labs.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that if&nbsp;you make a&nbsp;Pinterest board private the&nbsp;link you&nbsp;submit on&nbsp;Canvas won’t function properly and&nbsp;you’ll get&nbsp;a temporary zero and&nbsp;have a&nbsp;temporary heart&nbsp;attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">No need for&nbsp;heart attacks here. Just fix&nbsp;your mistakes and&nbsp;we’ll move&nbsp;forward.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;create my&nbsp;brand voice today because I&nbsp;had not&nbsp;given it&nbsp;much thought beforehand except for&nbsp;one initial idea. I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;made my&nbsp;pinterest board limited to&nbsp;that idea instead of&nbsp;letting myself get&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;other images I&nbsp;found in&nbsp;my search. I&nbsp;just wanted it&nbsp;all to&nbsp;look cohesive right&nbsp;away. Coming up&nbsp;with words was&nbsp;challenging for&nbsp;me too. I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;started a&nbsp;few words and&nbsp;looked for&nbsp;images around that instead of&nbsp;using the&nbsp;one concept I&nbsp;had in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Maybe the&nbsp;process you&nbsp;described would work better for&nbsp;you. The&nbsp;hardest part of&nbsp;teaching design process is&nbsp;that sometimes I&nbsp;make it&nbsp;sound like it’s the&nbsp;only possible process, and&nbsp;it’s absolute not. I’m&nbsp;just giving you&nbsp;tools to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;your own&nbsp;process in&nbsp;the future. Once you&nbsp;try a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different processes, you’ll know what works best for&nbsp;you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Explaining your thoughts to&nbsp;someone else can&nbsp;be helpful in&nbsp;solidifying your own&nbsp;ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Absolutely! Learning by&nbsp;teaching beats learning by&nbsp;doing every&nbsp;day.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that Pinterest is&nbsp;not all&nbsp;that reliable when trying to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;specific things, only things that are&nbsp;generally connected to&nbsp;a specific topic. I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;getting some great stuff for&nbsp;my group mates, though, which was&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;neat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Pinterest is&nbsp;<strong>terrible</strong> if&nbsp;you’re <em>looking</em> for&nbsp;images. It’s a&nbsp;tool to&nbsp;<em>collect</em> the&nbsp;images you&nbsp;find&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Coming up&nbsp;with mood boards proved challenging. It&nbsp;took more effort, to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;few images that felt cohesive with the&nbsp;brand voice I&nbsp;wanted. I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;niche that I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;can start with, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;keep my&nbsp;eyes open for&nbsp;more things that speak to&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, please do&nbsp;keep your eyes open. The&nbsp;work is&nbsp;not done until it’s&nbsp;done.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Creating a&nbsp;mood board with images not&nbsp;directly relating to&nbsp;the type of&nbsp;product you’re selling definitely seems as&nbsp;though it&nbsp;would fuel ideas moreso than just sticking with inspiration from already-made&nbsp;products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Absolutely. It’s from association of&nbsp;ideas that new&nbsp;ideas will&nbsp;come.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I noticed that I&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;started with one&nbsp;idea but&nbsp;as I&nbsp;found more images and&nbsp;references my&nbsp;direction shifted a&nbsp;bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That was&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;goals.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>To me, mood boards have always been stuff like colors and&nbsp;cool pictures of&nbsp;neatly decorated houses. I&nbsp;never really considered that fonts might work great on&nbsp;a mood board, which is&nbsp;what happened this&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">For every project, you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;your references&nbsp;first.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like working in&nbsp;teams to&nbsp;get feedback on&nbsp;my ideas. I&nbsp;am glad everyone is&nbsp;so nice and&nbsp;helpful in&nbsp;this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s one&nbsp;thing you&nbsp;can often count in&nbsp;the GrC&nbsp;program,&nbsp;right?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think that the&nbsp;most difficult part of&nbsp;packaging branding is&nbsp;coming up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;idea that stands out&nbsp;but does not&nbsp;make your product unrecognizable to&nbsp;consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Challenging indeed. You’ll get&nbsp;there, but&nbsp;not without making&nbsp;adjustments.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Myself and&nbsp;others have found a&nbsp;few examples of&nbsp;brand like Burger King and&nbsp;McDonald’s changing their visual language to&nbsp;be more minimalist and&nbsp;a modern. This is&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;interesting since it&nbsp;just them away from the&nbsp;more “cheap and&nbsp;easy” look, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;guess a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;other fast food chains are&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;looking less like fast&nbsp;food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s probably it. They’re probably trying to&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;compete with other chains that are&nbsp;fast and&nbsp;inexpensive, but&nbsp;don’t seem too&nbsp;“fast food”, like Blaze&nbsp;Pizza and&nbsp;Chipotle.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found this cool website that features a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;different packaging examples. Link: <a href="https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/" target="_blank">https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for&nbsp;sharing,&nbsp;Mads!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;very curious about some of&nbsp;the more vintage fonts I&nbsp;found while building my&nbsp;mood board. My&nbsp;friend and&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been designing a&nbsp;game as&nbsp;a side project and&nbsp;we’ve had&nbsp;trouble nailing down the&nbsp;overall aesthetic. However, the&nbsp;whole “futurepunk” and&nbsp;“vintage sci-fi” look has&nbsp;really inspired&nbsp;me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That sounds fun! Let&nbsp;us know how&nbsp;it&nbsp;goes!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The past, the&nbsp;present and&nbsp;the future walk into a&nbsp;bar. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;tense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks,&nbsp;James!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Yesterday in&nbsp;lab I&nbsp;learned that Bruno doesn’t listen to&nbsp;music from “this millenium", if&nbsp;I&nbsp;remember his&nbsp;words correctly. So&nbsp;he should look up&nbsp;Still Woozy and&nbsp;some other artists from this millenium. Like Polo &amp; Pan. And&nbsp;Kaytranada.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I will.&nbsp;Thanks!</p>
