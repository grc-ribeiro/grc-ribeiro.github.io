<h1>Class journal, week 8  </h1>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Seeing other examples of&nbsp;extension from real life and&nbsp;classmates helped make the&nbsp;process more tangible. Although, I&nbsp;spent the&nbsp;majority of&nbsp;lab “perfecting” just the&nbsp;different sock&nbsp;flavors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t think there’s such thing as a perfect flavor of socks. Although, I must confess it’s just an assumption since I never tried to eat them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I thought the&nbsp;Market Pantry product line was&nbsp;a very interesting example. I&nbsp;never noticed how&nbsp;all the&nbsp;fonts were different, but&nbsp;the color scheme keeps everything&nbsp;cohesive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I found it surprising and interesting when I first noticed it too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m learning a&nbsp;lot about Adobe Dimensions with this project. Using Adobe Stock for&nbsp;the first time has&nbsp;also been interesting. I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea they had&nbsp;3D models to&nbsp;use, though admittedly limiting users to&nbsp;10 model downloads a&nbsp;month seemed a&nbsp;little&nbsp;weird.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad Adobe Dimensions is working for you. But that limitation is weird indeed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What was&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the application used in&nbsp;GrC 337&nbsp;to make 3D&nbsp;models of&nbsp;packaging? Ever since the&nbsp;Cal Poly dashboard has&nbsp;been updated, I&nbsp;can’t go&nbsp;back and&nbsp;access previous quarters’ data and&nbsp;I&nbsp;was hoping to&nbsp;use that software for&nbsp;my line&nbsp;extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You may have learned iC3D, but I’d try Adobe Dimensions first.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think that it&nbsp;is interesting to&nbsp;see the&nbsp;ways that brands differentiate between products, like light colors for&nbsp;“light” food items. I&nbsp;personally subconsciously recognized this pattern but&nbsp;don’t usually think about it&nbsp;when&nbsp;shopping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Part of the design process is to make conscious decision based on audience’s unconscious understanding.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’ve been having a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;designer’s block in&nbsp;figuring out&nbsp;how everything will fit&nbsp;together, but&nbsp;with Dimensions its&nbsp;all finally coming together, especially with the&nbsp;unified branding. Feels&nbsp;good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The visual language looks much better in 3D mockups.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Reminding myself to&nbsp;change very few&nbsp;things between varieties of&nbsp;the same product helped me&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;a consistent&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Changing only as much as necessary sounds like a good way to go.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Differentiating shapes for&nbsp;different products and&nbsp;colors for&nbsp;flavors or&nbsp;scents seems to&nbsp;get pretty complicated pretty fast, just having 2&nbsp;flavors or&nbsp;scents in&nbsp;your line can&nbsp;double the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;designs you&nbsp;have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You don’t need to show all flavors/scents for all products, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the world’s worst thesaurus. Not&nbsp;only is&nbsp;it awful, it’s&nbsp;awful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks, Daniel.</p>
