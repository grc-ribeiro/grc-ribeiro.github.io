<h1>Class journal, week 5  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;get better about bringing my&nbsp;laptop into class so&nbsp;I&nbsp;can actually work on&nbsp;my files. That was&nbsp;an&nbsp;oversight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s what I’d do if I was a student.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;see how&nbsp;your logo will look as&nbsp;a part of&nbsp;a design and&nbsp;not just floating in&nbsp;space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. That’s how you can evaluate it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The visual ideation lab&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit challenging as&nbsp;I&nbsp;found myself designing a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;metaphorical visual&nbsp;identities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It was supposed to be challenging.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week has&nbsp;been extra exhausting. Coming into lab, I&nbsp;was not&nbsp;looking forward to&nbsp;finding my&nbsp;creative juices and&nbsp;work on&nbsp;the visual ideation. I&nbsp;feel as&nbsp;if I&nbsp;am running low&nbsp;on creativity, maybe it&nbsp;is because I&nbsp;need a&nbsp;refresher away from screens for&nbsp;some time. It&nbsp;is week 5&nbsp;and I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;think I&nbsp;was ready for&nbsp;in-person again and&nbsp;the exhaustion that it&nbsp;brings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I hear you. Try to get some quality time outdoors if you can.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;a little difficult doing this week’s quiz. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a long time to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;logos that I&nbsp;like and&nbsp;then research designers. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;information about who&nbsp;designs logos is&nbsp;not readily available which is&nbsp;sad because I&nbsp;feel like those designers don’t get&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of recognition. Even though it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;long time it&nbsp;was very&nbsp;interesting!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It was supposed to be challenging too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Its so&nbsp;hard not&nbsp;to completely imitate other logo designs and&nbsp;styles off&nbsp;the internet while still using them for&nbsp;inspiration. Its&nbsp;not that I’m trying to&nbsp;copy them, just their most outstanding elements… this becomes difficult when there are&nbsp;only two&nbsp;or three elements present in&nbsp;the first&nbsp;place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Start by copying, then we can improve it and make it closer to your brand values. In the end, it will be very different from the original.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Throwing a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;ideas down helped me&nbsp;make a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;iterations. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a while before I&nbsp;started finding ideas that I&nbsp;was really&nbsp;into. What helped even more was getting ideas from my group mates that lead to another whole set of ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s how it’s supposed to be.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I wonder what makes arbitrary logos effective as&nbsp;people can&nbsp;be confused on&nbsp;what the&nbsp;connection it&nbsp;has with the&nbsp;company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Any logo, arbitrary or not, can be confusing if you think about it. You just need to make sure it doesn’t convey anything contrary to your brand values.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I definitely want to&nbsp;check out&nbsp;that “Marks of&nbsp;Excellence” book featured in&nbsp;the&nbsp;video!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I have a copy in my office, you’re welcome to borrow it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For next week I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;might look at&nbsp;the ways that my&nbsp;logos can&nbsp;be displayed - (the whole thing with the&nbsp;name and&nbsp;possible imagery vs&nbsp;just the&nbsp;imagery, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good idea.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My next steps will be&nbsp;to create more designs/iconography for&nbsp;my packaging. I&nbsp;thought single colours would look good but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;needs something&nbsp;more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Did you&nbsp;know there is&nbsp;an actual word in&nbsp;the English language for&nbsp;pushing someone out&nbsp;a window? “Defenestration”. What had&nbsp;to happen for&nbsp;a singular word to&nbsp;be created for&nbsp;the&nbsp;action?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I actually sort of knew that. We have a similar word in Portuguese, but it can be using for throwing things out of a window too.</p>
