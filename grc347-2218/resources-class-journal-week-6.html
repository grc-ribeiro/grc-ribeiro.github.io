<h1>Class journal, week 6  </h1>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s hard trying to&nbsp;design a&nbsp;unique packaging shape that stands out&nbsp;but also doesn’t detract from its&nbsp;functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Your packaging shape doesn’t need to be unique.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>While researching materials, it’s difficult to&nbsp;find one&nbsp;that is&nbsp;environmentally friendly, able to&nbsp;match the&nbsp;properties of&nbsp;plastic, and&nbsp;is&nbsp;inexpensive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is hard. If it wasn’t, everybody would use it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>A basic principle in&nbsp;design including packaging is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;something is&nbsp;designed well, you&nbsp;should not&nbsp;need instructions to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s actually a popular oversimplification. Not all products must be intuitive, for complex systems with a specialized audience, training is necessary and therefore <em>guessability</em> is not as important as <em>learnability</em>. (Look it up.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>A couple of&nbsp;weeks ago, I&nbsp;started using this new&nbsp;script editor. Still trying to&nbsp;learn the&nbsp;shortcuts, I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;switch between a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;different JSON files that it&nbsp;had open. Given a&nbsp;common mental model for&nbsp;interacting with tabs, I&nbsp;did Command-2 and, lo&nbsp;and behold, it&nbsp;switched me&nbsp;to the&nbsp;second opened script. Such software, alongside packaging, includes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;good examples of&nbsp;these affordances, such as&nbsp;with different browsers or&nbsp;Adobe&nbsp;applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Mental models are very powerful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;example on&nbsp;affordance, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;little confused at&nbsp;first about what you&nbsp;meant by&nbsp;the shopping bag&nbsp;and scissors’ shapes inviting us&nbsp;to interact with the&nbsp;object. The&nbsp;light switch was&nbsp;more straight-forward because of&nbsp;the labels written on&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am guessing you&nbsp;meant the&nbsp;big open shape of&nbsp;the scissors and&nbsp;handles of&nbsp;the bag&nbsp;that would cause&nbsp;interaction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. You know how to use them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;make sure that my&nbsp;packaging uses the&nbsp;principle of&nbsp;form follows function, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;can feel myself thinking about form and&nbsp;aesthetic first just because of&nbsp;the original idea I&nbsp;had for&nbsp;my product. I&nbsp;will continue to&nbsp;push myself to&nbsp;prioritize functionality where it&nbsp;makes sense instead of&nbsp;just incorporating things because they look&nbsp;nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Don’t detract from functionality. Apple for years removed ports from its laptops frustrating its users that wanted HDMI or SD card readers. Last week, they brought it back. The new Macbook may not look as <em>sleek</em> as the previous model, but it’s a better computer.</p>
