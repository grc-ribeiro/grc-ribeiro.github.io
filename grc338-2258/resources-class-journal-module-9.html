<h1>Class journal, module 9 </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I learned what’s called the&nbsp;“rubber duck method,” where explaining how&nbsp;your code works to&nbsp;an inanimate object—such as&nbsp;a rubber duck—as if&nbsp;it were another person helps you&nbsp;to identify errors or&nbsp;where you&nbsp;made mistakes. (Last week I&nbsp;was actually explaining it&nbsp;to my&nbsp;brother, but&nbsp;this week I&nbsp;talked through it&nbsp;out loud to&nbsp;myself and&nbsp;it worked just the&nbsp;same).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Never heard of the “rubber duck method” before, but talking out loud and explaining what you’re doing sure helps.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I feel like every week it&nbsp;gets easier to&nbsp;make changes and&nbsp;I&nbsp;understand it&nbsp;more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">It’s working!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Rewatching the&nbsp;videos Bruno makes before lab&nbsp;makes going through the&nbsp;assignment a&nbsp;whole lot&nbsp;easier and&nbsp;faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Sounds obvious, right? More people should do that.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Use <code>max-width</code> in&nbsp;the div&nbsp;to create a&nbsp;background color around the&nbsp;content of&nbsp;the website (for wider browsers).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">And the assignment is due on Friday. You may have time to fix your submission if you didn’t use <code>max-width</code>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>If an&nbsp;assignment says check back to&nbsp;another, check back, the&nbsp;answer lies in&nbsp;there (saves you&nbsp;so much time and&nbsp;energy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I’m not trying to trick you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Read the&nbsp;tips first. I&nbsp;sat here trying to&nbsp;change my&nbsp;nav for&nbsp;easily 15&nbsp;minutes, until I&nbsp;saw you&nbsp;don’t have to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;a grid (what I&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;do, and&nbsp;it wasn’t working).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Again, I’m not trying to trick you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Always always always read through the&nbsp;entire assignment, especially the&nbsp;tips section. Whenever I’ve had&nbsp;problems with my&nbsp;code, I’ll seek help from classmates and&nbsp;eventually make my&nbsp;way to&nbsp;Bruno where he&nbsp;tells me&nbsp;to just read the&nbsp;tips— and&nbsp;sure enough the&nbsp;solutions are&nbsp;all&nbsp;there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I really try to help you <em>not</em> to make those mistakes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Recognition over recall is&nbsp;a big&nbsp;reason for&nbsp;the graphical user interface in&nbsp;contemporary computers being considered more user-friendly than the&nbsp;command-line&nbsp;interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">True.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I’m assuming it’s better to&nbsp;start off&nbsp;with a&nbsp;smaller layout, then upscale to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;process of&nbsp;planning a&nbsp;responsive website much&nbsp;easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Correct. Design for mobile first.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Having someone else go&nbsp;over your code is&nbsp;really valuable. Helps spot mistakes you&nbsp;may not&nbsp;see the&nbsp;first or&nbsp;second time!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I wholeheartedly support it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>The best way&nbsp;to learn something in&nbsp;coding is&nbsp;to teach everyone around you&nbsp;in class:).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">You’re very right!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I learned that the&nbsp;picture superiority effect is&nbsp;more about using pictures to&nbsp;remember/recall information, rather than just using pictures as&nbsp;a method to&nbsp;understand something. I&nbsp;thought LEGO instruction books were a&nbsp;good example of&nbsp;picture superiority, but&nbsp;they don’t help you&nbsp;remember or&nbsp;recall steps; they just show you&nbsp;how to&nbsp;assemble the&nbsp;pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Exactly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>From the&nbsp;readings, I&nbsp;learned that the&nbsp;four main factors that contribute to&nbsp;the perceived trustworthiness of&nbsp;a website are&nbsp;design quality, upfront disclosure, comprehensive/correct/current content, and&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the&nbsp;web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Very good point!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Check that you&nbsp;are using the&nbsp;correct properties using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Good idea.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Does making a&nbsp;webpage work for&nbsp;mobile and&nbsp;web have any&nbsp;implications for&nbsp;the resolution of&nbsp;the images? If&nbsp;the display is&nbsp;too big&nbsp;or too&nbsp;small will images look fuzzy at&nbsp;that size? Should we&nbsp;always aim&nbsp;for larger image file sizes on&nbsp;websites or&nbsp;will that negatively impact loading&nbsp;time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Great question! It does impact resolution. And images that are too big will have longer loading time, which is an issue, of course. There are ways to make the image load with the more appropriate resolution, but we don’t need to worry about it in the context of this class. I do, however, appreciate your concern and interest in the topic!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>How would you&nbsp;recommend we&nbsp;organize our&nbsp;CSS?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">General rule is to go from less specific to more specific. (That is very vague rule, though.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I enjoyed using the&nbsp;media query, I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;super helpful tool to&nbsp;have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">It is super helpful. Essential actually.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I never thought about how&nbsp;changing the&nbsp;browser size would impact to&nbsp;code. I&nbsp;honestly don’t know how&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;worked, but&nbsp;it wasn’t creating a&nbsp;new CSS&nbsp;section for&nbsp;that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Now you know.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>What do the units in <code>div.container { min-height: 100vh }</code> mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">From <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-start/" target="_blank">Sitepoint</a>: “vh stands for viewport height. This unit is based on the height of the viewport. A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height. A value of 100vh is equal to 100% of the viewport height.” So what it’s doing is ensuring that the <code>div.container</code> will be at least as tall as the browser window. But it can be much taller if the content requires. I’ve included that declaration to make the footer always on the bottom of the page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>In CSS, when we&nbsp;put <code>img { display: block; }</code>, would altering the&nbsp;value change the&nbsp;shape of&nbsp;the&nbsp;img?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">It would not. But this declaration avoid some undesired behaviors in some cases.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Use <code>margin: auto;</code> to&nbsp;center child elements to&nbsp;parent&nbsp;container.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Make sure to&nbsp;always check and&nbsp;double check the&nbsp;list of&nbsp;mistakes to&nbsp;avoid!!! It’s easy points lost if&nbsp;you don’t check, and&nbsp;if there’s more than 3&nbsp;mistakes from that list, it’s an&nbsp;automatic 0, which we&nbsp;never&nbsp;want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Please do check the list of mistakes to avoid!</p>
