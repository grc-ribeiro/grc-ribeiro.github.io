<h1>Class journal, module 4 </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Always copy and&nbsp;paste from past work, because that past work definitely works. I&nbsp;also found it&nbsp;very helpful to&nbsp;reference past work when building up&nbsp;my CSS&nbsp;file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">We’re building up knowledge after all.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I found it&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;follow along with my&nbsp;own files while watching the&nbsp;videos, pausing as&nbsp;needed, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;can practice and&nbsp;reinforce what I’m learning. Not&nbsp;only that but&nbsp;sometimes its&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;photo from the&nbsp;video lecture and&nbsp;I&nbsp;can look back later without having to&nbsp;launch the&nbsp;video again and&nbsp;I&nbsp;find what im&nbsp;looking&nbsp;for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Smart choice.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I think its&nbsp;really helpful to&nbsp;take notes on&nbsp;the videos that we&nbsp;watch outside of&nbsp;lab because now&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel more prepared for&nbsp;the&nbsp;midterm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">And for the assignments too, right? (I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;so.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>It was&nbsp;helpful having my&nbsp;past GitHub open to&nbsp;see what code I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;make certain things&nbsp;happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s the idea.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I learned that shift refresh hard refreshes the&nbsp;page and&nbsp;sometimes Firefox has&nbsp;too much cache so&nbsp;it needs a&nbsp;hard&nbsp;refresh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I was surprised to see that in a local file rather than on the web.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I recommend “Live Preview” in&nbsp;VS Code to&nbsp;see your edits being made in&nbsp;real time, versus having to&nbsp;keep saving and&nbsp;refreshing on&nbsp;Firefox. Still make sure to&nbsp;double-check on&nbsp;Firefox here and&nbsp;there, but&nbsp;Live Preview definitely saves me&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I recommend against it. And I’ll not help you if you don’t have your file open in Firefox.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I was&nbsp;curious how&nbsp;publishing services like Squarespace and&nbsp;Framer deal with alternative text so&nbsp;I&nbsp;looked it&nbsp;up. Pretty interesting, turns out&nbsp;some have options for&nbsp;you to&nbsp;input the&nbsp;information, and&nbsp;some use&nbsp;AI to&nbsp;write an&nbsp;automatic&nbsp;description.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes. AI has been quite helpful with that. But as it is often (always?) the case, you have to check its work.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>It is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;use SVG&nbsp;files for&nbsp;uploading logos to&nbsp;websites as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;a vector file type rather than a&nbsp;raster image. It&nbsp;is important that when you&nbsp;are creating logos for&nbsp;a website, you&nbsp;should create outlines to&nbsp;preserve the&nbsp;fonts being&nbsp;used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s correct!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Visual Studio Code will help point out&nbsp;errors you&nbsp;may have in&nbsp;your code, and&nbsp;when typing font-<em>_</em>_, it&nbsp;will give you&nbsp;options under that&nbsp;menu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes. Then, you know what properties to use. (Don’t make them up.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Collaboration was&nbsp;super important on&nbsp;this project specifically, in&nbsp;my opinion. I&nbsp;think everyone has&nbsp;gotten to&nbsp;the same level of&nbsp;HTML/CSS knowledge but&nbsp;there were a&nbsp;few gaps in&nbsp;my knowledge that were easily filled in&nbsp;by my&nbsp;labmates, and&nbsp;vice versa. Sometimes it&nbsp;was as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;my partner’s code and&nbsp;instantly finding a&nbsp;mistake that kept getting past them for&nbsp;10~ mins. I&nbsp;think a&nbsp;fresh set&nbsp;of eyes is&nbsp;important when there’s so&nbsp;much code involved and&nbsp;I&nbsp;found myself needing help with small little mistakes a&nbsp;lot. It’s mutually beneficially to&nbsp;help out&nbsp;your lab&nbsp;partners as&nbsp;whenever I&nbsp;would help them out, they would return the&nbsp;favor within 10&nbsp;minutes when I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;ask an&nbsp;equally confusing&nbsp;question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Exactly. Keep helping each other and checking on each other’s work!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I also have been liking the&nbsp;group work because everyone always has&nbsp;pretty different examples, which help me&nbsp;see the&nbsp;topics in&nbsp;the real world in&nbsp;more&nbsp;places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I used to have this assignment as individual assignment only. Many years ago, I shifted it to group assignment with discussion, and it became a much better activity. More fun and more effective.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I loved the&nbsp;analogy about writing in&nbsp;phone numbers and&nbsp;how even if&nbsp;you are&nbsp;<strong>close</strong>, as&nbsp;in 9&nbsp;of the&nbsp;numbers are&nbsp;correct, if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;wrong then it&nbsp;won’t call the&nbsp;right number, obviously. I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;really well translated over to&nbsp;HTML in&nbsp;general but&nbsp;specifically for&nbsp;adding images to&nbsp;HTML, as&nbsp;if you&nbsp;write 99% of&nbsp;the image’s name correct but&nbsp;forget something as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;a hyphen, it&nbsp;won’t link and&nbsp;the image won’t appear. (This is&nbsp;also why&nbsp;we copy and&nbsp;paste names of&nbsp;stuff.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Precisely.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Keeping images inside a&nbsp;folder is&nbsp;personal preference; however, remember that the&nbsp;location of&nbsp;the image has&nbsp;to be&nbsp;reflected when naming the&nbsp;image in&nbsp;HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes. Very good point.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Something that keeps me&nbsp;on my&nbsp;toes is&nbsp;when I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;missing tag&nbsp;in my&nbsp;code that doesn’t affect anything visual. It’s easy to&nbsp;continue progressing in&nbsp;the project when everything looks correct even when something small is&nbsp;missing in&nbsp;the&nbsp;lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">It makes sense. You’ll get better at catching those.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>The alt&nbsp;attribute should be&nbsp;very descriptive, but&nbsp;you will need to&nbsp;use good judgement to&nbsp;avoid irrelevant&nbsp;details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">True. And that can be tricky. But a sentence is usually the right balance.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I’m curious how&nbsp;we style web&nbsp;pages to&nbsp;look good on&nbsp;different devices (like phones versus tablets versus computers).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">We’ll get there.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I’m still a&nbsp;little confused on&nbsp;where to&nbsp;put paddings and&nbsp;margins. I&nbsp;put margins in&nbsp;my header, but&nbsp;then I&nbsp;also put&nbsp;them in&nbsp;my h1, h2, etc. It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;work fine, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;doubt they need to&nbsp;be in&nbsp;both (or they do&nbsp;and I&nbsp;don’t know what I’m talking about).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Your first instinct was correct. You would only need them in the <code>header</code>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>What is&nbsp;the best way&nbsp;to add&nbsp;space between list items while not&nbsp;spacing out&nbsp;the lines of&nbsp;text of&nbsp;individual list&nbsp;items?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">If you want to make space between list items, give margin to the list items.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Would you&nbsp;recommend using GitHub to&nbsp;host a&nbsp;portfolio website or&nbsp;a different&nbsp;service?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I do recommend GitHub in general. I host my websites on GitHub Pages. However, you may want to use Squarespace, Wix, or similar service that will give you better content management.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I learned that accessibility is&nbsp;not optional and&nbsp;it is&nbsp;actually required by&nbsp;law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Rightfully so!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Next i’d like to&nbsp;learn how&nbsp;to make a&nbsp;carousel of&nbsp;photos that you&nbsp;can click through and&nbsp;toggle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s for GRC&nbsp;339.</p>
