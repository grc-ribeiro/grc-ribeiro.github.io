<h1>Class journal, module 5  </h1>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Getting frustrated at&nbsp;your code does not&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It does not.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Rewatching your videos is&nbsp;helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s why we have videos and not synchronous classes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I overcomplicated things a&nbsp;lot, the&nbsp;assignment was&nbsp;actually more straightforward than I&nbsp;thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It was quite straightforward. But you were not the only one that overcomplicated it. Far from it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really liked doing the&nbsp;lab before class because then I&nbsp;am not&nbsp;stressed&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You were not the only who did it before class this week. I’m glad to see more people taking this opportunity to get their work done.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For Google Chrome, the&nbsp;Developer Tools option is&nbsp;helpful for&nbsp;seeing the&nbsp;specific dimensions of&nbsp;grids on&nbsp;your working site (shortcut is&nbsp;option+cmd+i).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">True. They’re helpful, but Firefox’s is more complete.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found Firefox’s web&nbsp;developer tools to&nbsp;be really helpful while doing this project. I&nbsp;found many mistakes through editing straight into the&nbsp;web developer to&nbsp;see why&nbsp;some styles weren’t&nbsp;working.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, Firefox’s web&nbsp;developer tools are very helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You can&nbsp;see the&nbsp;code of&nbsp;a webpage on&nbsp;Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Or any browser. Look for <strong>Page source</strong> or <strong>View source</strong> (usually ⌘U).</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also learned that the&nbsp;best way&nbsp;to understand code and&nbsp;the information Bruno shares is&nbsp;to try&nbsp;and re-explain it&nbsp;to other classmates. : )</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It really is.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I spent an&nbsp;hour doing the&nbsp;assignment incorrectly and&nbsp;got frustrated. After asking a&nbsp;classmate for&nbsp;help, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;restart and&nbsp;finish within 10&nbsp;minutes. Its&nbsp;always important to&nbsp;ask for&nbsp;help when you&nbsp;need it!! I&nbsp;could’ve saved so&nbsp;much&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, you may want to start the assignment on your own, but you want to keep checking with your classmates.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s a&nbsp;group effort to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;new concepts sometimes but&nbsp;then things end&nbsp;up clicking and&nbsp;making&nbsp;sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And it’s more effective than if I just had given the answer to you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Callie helped show me&nbsp;that CSS&nbsp;grids are&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;simpler than I&nbsp;was making them out&nbsp;to be&nbsp;at&nbsp;first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They were indeed quite simple. I’m glad Callie showed it to you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Reilly saved my&nbsp;butt this&nbsp;lab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">She seems to have gotten a very good hang of HTML and CSS so far.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Reilly is&nbsp;the best&nbsp;tutor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There you go.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;Ashley for&nbsp;helping to&nbsp;explain what the&nbsp;concept of&nbsp;mental model was! I&nbsp;struggled a&nbsp;lot when first reading the&nbsp;pages. It’s interesting how&nbsp;our mental models or&nbsp;certain things works. We&nbsp;know how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;gadgets just judging based on&nbsp;our mental model and&nbsp;our previous&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s an extremely helpful principle.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For more CSS&nbsp;Grid practice, here’s a&nbsp;game that teaches grid through practical&nbsp;exercises: <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/" target="_blank">https://cssgridgarden.com/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Ziadin!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There is&nbsp;a big&nbsp;difference between a&nbsp;div container and&nbsp;grid container, its&nbsp;just unfortunate the&nbsp;names are&nbsp;similar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s ture.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>To add&nbsp;a grid using CSS&nbsp;we have to&nbsp;choose the&nbsp;main element that contains all&nbsp;of the&nbsp;information we&nbsp;want in&nbsp;the grid and&nbsp;type <code>display: grid;</code>. To add several columns to a grid, you write <code>grid-template-columns:</code> followed by the list of the widths each column should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bruno doesn’t often ask&nbsp;rhetorical questions, but&nbsp;he is&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;scary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Really? I have been called scary by students in many years, and I really don’t mean to come across as such. Would candy help to make me look less scary? Please stop by my office to get some candy to reward your honest comments.</p>

<p class="disclaimer">We all make mistakes, and I&nbsp;appreciate if&nbsp;you&nbsp;let&nbsp;me know when you&nbsp;catch any&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;several mistakes I’ll&nbsp;make this quarter. Students who&nbsp;find insconsistent dates or&nbsp;instructions on&nbsp;any&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;assignments will&nbsp;be&nbsp;rewarded with&nbsp;candy.</p>
