<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">At the end of every module of class, you need to write a brief journal on Canvas. It should not take you more than five minutes, though. <strong>The main point of the journal is to write down what are the main points you have learned,</strong> being from lectures, discussions, or lab activities. You may have learned content from the instructor, another student, or looking it up on your own. They&rsquo;re all valid.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">I will start every week by sharing with the class the highlights from the journal entries.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">Even though I will be able to know who wrote each entry, this information won&rsquo;t be shared with class, and the entries will be shared anonymously. If you submit a valid tip, I want to give you credit. (e.g.: &ldquo;Thanks for sharing, Alex!&rdquo;) If you want your tip to be shared anonymously, please let me know when you share it.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;"><strong>You may also include in the journal:</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">Links to some valuable resource you found.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">Your next steps on the project you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">Topics you want to investigate next.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">Concepts that have remained confusing.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; max-width: 36em;">Please take the time to write <strong>three to eight bullet points</strong>.</p>
