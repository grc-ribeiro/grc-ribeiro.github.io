<h1>Kinetic typography  </h1>

<p>This is a group assignment will be consisted of making a 90-to-120-second, informational, and&nbsp;educational movie.</p>

<p>The theme is open, but must be relevant to your audience. The broader the audience, the better.</p>

<p>The narrative must be based on facts, not opinions; and quantitative data, rather than qualitative data.</p>

<h2>Constraints  </h2>

<p>You may use type, motion, shapes, colors, sounds, music, voice, live video, or any element to tell the story. <strong>Emphasis on type in motion.</strong></p>

<p>You may use copyright-free, live action footage or vector, 2D illustration. This is not an animation course. If you’re using illustration, don’t try to make it realistic. Make it graphical, instead.</p>

<p>Music is required and sound effects are strongly advised.</p>

<p>(You are encouraged to have fun with the assignment, but it doesn’t mean you want it to be funny. Avoid jokes, puns, etc.)  </p>

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<p>You will be evaluated on the quality of your story, visual language, motion effects, and sound.</p>

<hr id="References-page" />

<h2>References page
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, each <strong>group</strong> needs to present their references for the project. I recommend using a board on Pinterest with 30 to 70 images and videos. (Make sure you have an exclusive board for the project.)</p>

<p>The refererence page counts for 10% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a link to your references until <strong>Friday,&nbsp;10&nbsp;November&nbsp;2018, at&nbsp;4:00&nbsp;pm</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Stills" />

<h2>Stills
  </h2>

<p>Using any software of your choice, design high-definition, still images of two or three frames of your video, to show the visual language. (Two&nbsp;or three screens <strong>per student</strong>.)</p>

<p>Stills count for 10% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p>Individual submissions to <strong>PolyLearn</strong>: Submit a multi-page PDF until <strong>Tuesday, 13&nbsp;November&nbsp;2018, at 8:00am</strong>, using the name convention <strong><em>lastname-stills.pdf</em></strong>.</p>

<hr id="Script" />

<h2>Script
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, each group should write a <strong>detailed script</strong> of their movie. Include all the text (on screen and narration), description of the images, and estimated timeframe. (You can find examples from previous years on PolyLearn.) </p>

<p>The script counts for 10% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p>Individual submissions to <strong>PolyLearn</strong>: Submit a multi-page PDF until <strong>Tuesday, 13&nbsp;November&nbsp;2018, at 8:00am</strong>, using the name convention <strong><em>lastname-script.pdf</em></strong>.</p>

<hr id="First-draft" />

<h2>First draft
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, a <em>first draft</em> of your project is due on <strong>November&nbsp;18th</strong>. This draft should consist of a series of videos (one movie per student), with iconography, colors, and typography as intended as final. It’s fine, however, if it lacks <em>any</em> motion. You may think of it as a <em>playable slideshow</em>, or roughly one frame every two or three seconds, as needed. Also, all choices made to this point are open to discussion before final submission. </p>

<p>The first draft counts for 15% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Individual submissions</strong> to <strong>PolyLearn</strong>: Submit a link to your video on <em>Vimeo</em> or <em>YouTube</em> until <strong>Saturday,&nbsp;18&nbsp;November&nbsp;2018, at 4:00&nbsp;pm</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Second-draft" />

<h2>Second draft
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, a <em>second draft</em> of your project is due on <strong>November&nbsp;29th</strong>. This draft should consist of a full-length video, with iconography, colors, typography, and motion as intended as final. It’s fine, however, if it lacks refinement and secondary animation. Also, all choices made to this point are open to discussion, of course.</p>

<p>The second draft counts for 25% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Group submissions</strong> to <strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a link to your video on <em>Vimeo</em> or <em>YouTube</em> until <strong>Friday,&nbsp;30&nbsp;November&nbsp;2018, at 11:55&nbsp;pm</strong>.</p>
