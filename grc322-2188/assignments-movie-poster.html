<h1>Movie poster  </h1>

<p>This assignment will be consisted of making a 24×36″ poster for a movie. The hypothetical movie needs to be based on a fiction book or short novel of your choice, as long as it hasn’t been featured on screens. Also, it must not be a children’s book either.</p>

<h2>Constraints  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Highlight title, main actors, and director of the movie. </p></li>
<li><p>Include writers, producers, other actors, music, etc… You can download <a href="../images/tipsquirrel-poster-credit-block.zip">this template</a> to help you, but you don’t have to. (Thanks for sharing, Ivy!)</p></li>
<li><p>You may use a combination type, lettering, illustration, photograph, or anything you want to represent your movie.</p></li>
<li><p>You may use copyright-free images you find on the internet, for example, but you need to make sure it’s at least 150&nbsp;ppi in the final output.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="../images/mpaa-rating.zip">MPAA rate logo</a> is required. </p></li>
<li><p>A studio logo is required. I’m <a href="../images/studio-logos.zip">sharing</a> some here, but you can look for any other studio on <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com">Brands of the World</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(You are encouraged to have fun with the assignment, but it doesn’t mean you want it to be funny. Avoid jokes, puns, etc.)</p>
