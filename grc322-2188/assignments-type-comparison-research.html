<h1>Type comparison  </h1>

<h2>Research  </h2>

<p>For this assignment, each group will be assigned with one pair of typefaces from&nbsp;this&nbsp;list:</p>

<p>Bodoni vs Didot <br />
Franklin Gothic vs Trade Gothic <br />
Adobe Garamond vs Minion <br />
Helvetica vs Univers <br />
Frutiger vs Myriad <br />
Sabon vs Times <br />
Avenir vs Gotham <br />
Clarendon vs Eames Century <br />
DIN vs Interstate <br />
Memphis vs Serifa <br />
Meta vs Officina <br />
Baskerville vs Caslon <br />
Avant Garde vs Futura <br />
Gill Sans vs Johnston</p>

<p>The first part of the assignment is to extensively research and compare the&nbsp;two&nbsp;typefaces. </p>

<p>Your report must be portrait and letter-sized. For the main text use a typeface that is very different from both typefaces you are researching. Suggestion: if your typefaces are sans-serif, use a serif typeface for your copy; and vice-versa.</p>

<p>You must include:</p>

<ol>
<li><h2>History of each typeface  </h2>

<p>For each typeface, include facts such as who design it, when, and where. Also, explain if there was a specific purpose for its design and the historical context of its creation. </p></li>
<li><h2>Comparison  </h2>

<p>Explain, through images and diagrams, what are the biggest similarities and big differences between the two typefaces assigned to your group.  </p></li>
<li><h2>Examples and visual references  </h2>

<p>Research images where the use of the typefaces were particularly successful. <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts&nbsp;In&nbsp;Use</a> can be a very helpful starting point.</p></li>
</ol>
