<h2>Paragraph and character styles {{styles}}  </h2>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/paragraph-character-styles.html)">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A character style is a collection of character formatting attributes that can be applied to text in a single step. A paragraph style includes both character and paragraph formatting attributes, and can be applied to a paragraph or range of paragraphs. Paragraph styles and character styles are found on separate panels. Paragraph and characters styles are sometimes called text styles.</p>

<p>When you change the formatting of a style, all text to which the style has been applied will be updated with the new format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our template, you will find five folders on the <em>Paragraph Styles</em> panel. On the <em>Main styles</em> folder, you will find four styles: <em>Paragraph</em>, <em>Heading 1</em>, <em>Heading 2</em>, <em>Heading 3</em>, <em>Ordered lists</em>, <em>Unordered lists</em>, and <em>Captions</em>. Those are the paragraph styles that you will need to work on your document. In case, you <strong>need</strong> another style, include it in this same folder. (But make sure you actually <em>need</em> another style.)</p>

<p>On the <em>Character Styles</em> panel, you will find three styles that you may need: <em>Medium</em>, <em>Italic</em>, and <em>Medium Italic</em>. </p>

<p>All text styles use Helvetica Neue, which is a system font on the Mac. If you’re using Windows, you may need to install Helvetica Neue. Alternatively, you may replace Helvetica Neue with another font, but check the options with the me.</p>

<h2>Master pages and layers {{masters}}  </h2>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/master-pages.html">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A master is like a background that you can quickly apply to many pages. Objects on a master appear on all pages with that master applied. Master items that appear on document pages are surrounded by a dotted border. Changes you make to a master are automatically applied to associated pages. Masters commonly contain repeating logos, page numbers, headers, and footers. They can also contain empty text or graphic frames that serve as placeholders on document pages. A master item cannot be selected on a document page unless the master item is overridden.</p>

<p>Masters can have multiple layers, just like pages in your document. Objects on a single layer have their own stacking order within that layer. Objects on a master page layer appear behind objects assigned to the same layer in the document page.</p>

<p>If you want a master item to appear in front of objects on the document page, assign a higher layer to the object on the master. A master item on a higher layer appears in front of all objects on lower layers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The object on the masters are on the layer <em>Info</em>. This layer is on the background and it’s locked; the information on this layer should be changed through <a href="#variables">variables</a>.</p>

<p>On the <em>Layers</em> panel, you will find three other layers. The layer <em>Comment</em> is not only locked but it’s also set not to print. Therefore, it doesn’t show if you’re working on <em>Preview</em> mode.</p>

<p>Your content should go on the <strong><em>Content</em></strong> layer, where the placeholder content already is.</p>

<h2>Thread text frames {{threads}}  </h2>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/threading-text.html">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The text in a frame can be independent of other frames, or it can flow between connected frames. To flow text between connected frames (also called text boxes), you must first connect the frames. Connected frames can be on the same page or spread, or on another page in the document. The process of connecting text among frames is called <em>threading text</em>. It is also referred to as <em>linking text frames</em> or <em>linking text boxes</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never, in any circumstance, you should break the thread. All text in your document should be in one thread of linked text frames. (One frame per page.)</p>

<h2>Images {{images}}  </h2>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/placing-graphics.html">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Place</em> command is the primary method used to insert graphics into InDesign because it provides the highest level of&nbsp;support for resolution, file formats, multipage PDF and INDD files, and color. To place graphics is also referred to as import images and insert pictures.</p>

<p>The options available to you when you place a graphics file depend on the type of graphic. These options appear when you select <em>Show Import Options</em> in the <em>Place</em> dialog box. If you don’t select <em>Show Import Options</em>, InDesign applies the default settings or the last settings used in placing a graphics file of that type.</p>

<p>The names of graphics you’ve placed (imported) appear in the <em>Links</em> panel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you place an image or graphic into your document, you want to anchor it to the main text, so you don’t need to worry about moving it around when you edit the text. You can also anchor other objects, such as text boxes with side notes or captions.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/anchored-objects.html">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anchored objects are items, such as images or text boxes, that are attached—or anchored—to specific text. The anchored object travels with the text containing the anchor as the text reflows. Use anchored objects for all objects that you want associated with a particular line or block of text, for example, sidebars and callouts, figures, or icons associated with a specific word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may want to check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU8QN5qXcCk">video on how to anchor images to text in InDesign</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to include an image that takes all or most of the page, keep using the same story (thread), through linked text boxes. Anchor your image to the top of the text box and insert a page break (<em>Type > Insert Break Character > Page Break</em>).</p>

<h2>Table of content {{toc}}  </h2>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/creating-table-contents.html">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A table of contents (TOC) can list the contents of a book, magazine, or other publication; display a list of illustrations, advertisers, or photo credits; or include other information to help readers find information in a document or book file. One document may contain multiple tables of contents—for example, a list of chapters and a list of illustrations.</p>

<p>The process for creating a table of contents requires three main steps. First, create and apply the paragraph styles you’ll use as the basis for the TOC. Second, specify which styles are used in the TOC and how the TOC is formatted. Third, flow the TOC into your document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably want to watch some of these <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=toc+indesign+youtube">videos on how to create a table of content in InDesign</a>. You don’t, however, need to worry about it. The table of contents has been created and will be automatically updated if you continue to use paragraph styles, which you should anyway. Go to <em>Layout > Update Table of Content</em> in InDesign before export your file to PDF.</p>

<h2>Variables {{variables}}  </h2>

<p>From <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/text-variables.html">Adobe website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A text variable is an item you insert in your document that varies according to the context. For example, the Last Page Number variable displays the page number of the last page of the document. If you add or remove pages, the variable is updated accordingly.</p>

<p>InDesign includes several preset text variables that you can insert in your document. You can edit the format of these variables, or you can create your own. Some variables, such as Running Header and Chapter Number, are especially useful for adding to master pages to ensure consistent formatting and numbering. Other variables, such as Creation Date and File Name, are useful for adding to the slug area for printing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the variables we use on this project are custom text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This variable is commonly used for inserting placeholder text, or a text string that may need to be changed quickly. For example, if you’re working on a project that uses a code name for a company, you can create a custom text variable for the code name. When you are able to use the real company name, you can simply change the variable to update all the occurrences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re not on <em>Preview</em> mode (<em>View > Screen Mode > Normal</em>), you will be able to see the comments on the screen. They will help you with the variables. To change variables, you need to go to <em>Type > Text Variables > Define…</em> and select the proper variable, according to the comments on the document.</p>

<h2>Exporting to PDF {{pdf}}  </h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to <em>File&nbsp;> Export</em>.  </li>
<li>Specify a name and location for the file.  </li>
<li>Choose <em>Adobe PDF (Print)</em>.  </li>
<li>Hit <em>Save</em>.  </li>
<li><em>Export Layers: Visible &amp; Printable Layers</em>.  </li>
<li>Hit <em>Export</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>Important</strong>: Don’t use workarounds. Search for the proper way to work in InDesign. Seek for help if you believe the resources you were able to find are not helpful enough. This page is a good start, but I can help too, of course.</h4>
