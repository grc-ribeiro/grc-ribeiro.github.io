<h1>Type comparison  </h1>

<h2>Research  </h2>

<p>For this assignment, each group will be assigned with two typefaces. The first part of the assignment is to extensively research and compare the two typefaces. You must include:</p>

<ol>
<li><h2>History of each typeface  </h2>

<p>For each typeface, include facts such as who design it, when, and where. Also, explain if there was a specific purpose for its design and the historical context of its creation. </p></li>
<li><h2>Comparison  </h2>

<p>Explain, through images and diagrams, what are the biggest similarities and big differences between the two typefaces assigned to your group.  </p></li>
<li><h2>Examples and visual references  </h2>

<p>Research images where the use of the typefaces were particularly successful. <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts&nbsp;In&nbsp;Use</a> and <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/">MyFonts</a> can be two very helpful starting points.</p></li>
</ol>
