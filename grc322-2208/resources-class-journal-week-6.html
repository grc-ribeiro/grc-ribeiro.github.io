<h1>Class journal, week 6  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Your assignment breakdowns are&nbsp;also very clear and&nbsp;concise.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I’m confused about something, I&nbsp;can easily scroll through the&nbsp;different sections of&nbsp;the assignment and&nbsp;find what I’m looking for, and&nbsp;the entire assignment sheet has&nbsp;a clear&nbsp;hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m always trying to be as clear as possible. Sometimes, students will come back with questions, and I realize I could’ve been more clear. Then I learn from my mistakes too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The “International Typographic Style” poster in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Research Poster video was&nbsp;very interesting to&nbsp;me and&nbsp;definitely caught my&nbsp;eye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I love that poster. I need a copy of it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Designing for&nbsp;such a&nbsp;large size is&nbsp;much different than what we&nbsp;have previously been working on. It&nbsp;is nice to&nbsp;have so&nbsp;much space but&nbsp;I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;remind myself just because it’s there I&nbsp;don’t need to&nbsp;fill every&nbsp;inch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">All true. It is very different. Also, you don’t need to fill every inch.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think learning to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;interesting academic/ research poster is&nbsp;a useful skill for&nbsp;the future as&nbsp;it can&nbsp;be applied to&nbsp;many different projects and&nbsp;presentations. It&nbsp;makes conveying information convenient and&nbsp;interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It really is.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;a relief to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;good grade on&nbsp;the Designer Poster final submission. I&nbsp;spent a&nbsp;really long time going over all&nbsp;the comments/rubric and&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;be as&nbsp;detailed as&nbsp;I&nbsp;could in&nbsp;the explanation. I’m glad that the&nbsp;effort was&nbsp;reflected in&nbsp;my&nbsp;grade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">More important, the effort was reflected in your work.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;excited for&nbsp;the font comparison poster, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope that I&nbsp;like mine enough to&nbsp;print it&nbsp;out and&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on my&nbsp;own&nbsp;wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I too hope I like yours to print it out and put it on my wall. I used to have some posters from this assignment on my wall. I&nbsp;should print some new ones.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think it’s really cool how&nbsp;we are&nbsp;now combining what we&nbsp;learned from the&nbsp;last two&nbsp;projects into another project. Really reinforces what we&nbsp;are learning in&nbsp;this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And the results are showing it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I liked having to&nbsp;write out&nbsp;the explanations for&nbsp;our design decisions last week. Some of&nbsp;the explanations I’d thought out&nbsp;beforehand as&nbsp;I&nbsp;was designing, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;sit down and&nbsp;think about a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;them, and&nbsp;it helped me&nbsp;mess with the&nbsp;final poster until I&nbsp;liked&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That was the idea. To write is to think.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Like last week, I&nbsp;appreciate that you&nbsp;show examples of&nbsp;past students’ work. It’s incredibly helpful to&nbsp;reference someone else’s work when you’ve never designed anything like a&nbsp;research poster&nbsp;before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Try not to look only on my examples, though. Always look for references from good designers when working. The list for the designers’ posters assignment is a good start.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>An entry point is&nbsp;a point of&nbsp;physical or&nbsp;attentional entry into a&nbsp;design. This is&nbsp;what usually catches your attention first upon first-glance.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In looking at&nbsp;research poster examples on&nbsp;my own, I&nbsp;noticed many of&nbsp;them fail to&nbsp;include an&nbsp;effective point of&nbsp;entry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. That’s a big part of it. And lack of blank space.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;grid on&nbsp;our poster, I&nbsp;was confused about how&nbsp;much we&nbsp;can expand our&nbsp;stylistic elements. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;am bleeding a&nbsp;title or&nbsp;large element, how&nbsp;do I&nbsp;still align to&nbsp;my&nbsp;grid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">When you bleed, you break the grid. And it’s fine.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I just wanted you&nbsp;to know that I&nbsp;was working on&nbsp;a powerpoint for&nbsp;senior project this week and&nbsp;couldn’t bring myself to&nbsp;center-align any&nbsp;of my&nbsp;text. So. You’ve had&nbsp;in impact. :p</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And it’s hard, isn’t it? It’s tempting to just center everything and feel like you’ve done <em>something</em> with type. Not centering is harder, but worth it. Nothing great comes easy, etc.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I still get&nbsp;confused on&nbsp;using grids for&nbsp;different sized fonts. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;use a&nbsp;font size that doesn’t match with the&nbsp;horizontal grid, should I&nbsp;still use&nbsp;it? Or&nbsp;do I&nbsp;always need to&nbsp;edit the&nbsp;leading/font point size so&nbsp;that the&nbsp;text lines up&nbsp;somewhere with the&nbsp;horizontal&nbsp;grid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I edit everything to make the design more systematic.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really enjoy seeing other peoples work, will we&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;see everyones completed posters at&nbsp;the&nbsp;end?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They’ll be your study material for the midterm.</p>
