<h1>Class journal, week 2  </h1>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Ask questions about anything you&nbsp;might be&nbsp;unsure&nbsp;about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please do. I welcome clarification questions.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like how&nbsp;the class is&nbsp;neatly structured on&nbsp;canvas but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think having some additional resources (such as&nbsp;informational worksheets on&nbsp;the topic we&nbsp;are covering in&nbsp;that week, where the&nbsp;information is&nbsp;consolidated onto a&nbsp;page with some visuals) would be&nbsp;beneficial because the&nbsp;information goes by&nbsp;so quickly in&nbsp;the&nbsp;videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can always stop the videos and rewatch, but I did make the PDF for the type anatomy lecture available for consulting.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Will we&nbsp;be using and&nbsp;learning more about InDesign like we&nbsp;did in&nbsp;GrC 318? I&nbsp;found that aspect of&nbsp;that class to&nbsp;be useful and&nbsp;was wondering how&nbsp;322 will compare to&nbsp;318 since they are&nbsp;both digital&nbsp;typography.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s not as InDesign heavy, but I’ll try to give some InDesign tips every now and then.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Meeting with you&nbsp;on Zoom REALLY helped, I&nbsp;will definitely be&nbsp;meeting with you&nbsp;more often if&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;confused!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;for having such flexible office hours, scheduling on&nbsp;Calendly was&nbsp;so easy and&nbsp;I&nbsp;really appreciated getting some feedback on&nbsp;the pixel font assignment in&nbsp;person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s my first time using Calendly. I didn’t want to use something new. But since everybody else is using, I figured it was the easiest for you students.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Also thank you&nbsp;for making your videos concise, to&nbsp;the point, and&nbsp;digestible. I&nbsp;truly look forward to&nbsp;watching them knowing I&nbsp;will be&nbsp;receiving valuable&nbsp;information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for the kind words. Let me know if you feel they are not as valuable anymore, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think other people have mentioned this, but&nbsp;having shorter, concise videos for&nbsp;lectures is&nbsp;extremely helpful. Long videos that are&nbsp;half an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;an hour long are&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;get through while staying attentive or&nbsp;even staying awake. And&nbsp;when there is&nbsp;a piece of&nbsp;information you&nbsp;missed or&nbsp;want to&nbsp;go back to&nbsp;at a&nbsp;later date, you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;search and&nbsp;scroll through the&nbsp;entire video just to&nbsp;get what you&nbsp;need. Shorter videos keep things less overwhelming, easier to&nbsp;remember, and&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;go back and&nbsp;find anything that needs further&nbsp;explanation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad it’s working for most people.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>As frustrating as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;to struggle with what seemed like a&nbsp;simple assignment, nothing great was&nbsp;made easily&nbsp;right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Struggle is normal, but I didn’t mean it to be as frustrating as it seems to be the case.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I loved how&nbsp;we were given an&nbsp;additional submission for&nbsp;the pixel assignment. I&nbsp;appreciate how&nbsp;you were able to&nbsp;pivot your schedule to&nbsp;help us&nbsp;best learn and&nbsp;review the&nbsp;assignment. Creating the&nbsp;additional video was&nbsp;very&nbsp;helpful!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">My first time teaching this class online. And my first time giving this assignment in years. We’re all making adjustments. Thanks for your patience.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think the&nbsp;reason I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;off in&nbsp;doing the&nbsp;pixel assignment was&nbsp;I&nbsp;was focusing more on&nbsp;designing something unique rather than designing for&nbsp;readability/legibility. Now&nbsp;I&nbsp;know it’s more about readability/legibility and&nbsp;a little&nbsp;personality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You got it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m still not&nbsp;fully visualizing the&nbsp;disconnected letters from the&nbsp;video as&nbsp;more legible; to&nbsp;me it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t think they’re more legible. They’re legible enough and a valid compromise if you want to keep the descenders. But to design is to make decision.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In the&nbsp;future, I&nbsp;think you&nbsp;should include a&nbsp;version of&nbsp;the numbers in&nbsp;the gray color scheme in&nbsp;the assignment description. I&nbsp;think that would have cleared up&nbsp;some&nbsp;confusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I will! Thanks for the suggestion!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;painful to&nbsp;see my&nbsp;grade from my&nbsp;first attempt at&nbsp;the pixel font assignment. I&nbsp;knew that some of&nbsp;my letters were not&nbsp;perfect, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;was not&nbsp;expecting that mark. Thank you&nbsp;for giving us&nbsp;another chance to&nbsp;turn in&nbsp;a&nbsp;draft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I didn’t mean it to be painful, but it was never meant to count towards final grade. Like you said, the only thing I changed was the second opportunity for a draft before the final submission.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My next step for&nbsp;improving my&nbsp;font was&nbsp;printing out&nbsp;the grids on&nbsp;paper. I&nbsp;have always worked better by&nbsp;hand with pencil and&nbsp;paper and&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;brainstorm and&nbsp;create a&nbsp;font in&nbsp;illustrator did&nbsp;not work for&nbsp;me. Sketching things by&nbsp;hand is&nbsp;an important first step for&nbsp;me when designing or&nbsp;creating anything. I&nbsp;can then take my&nbsp;sketches and&nbsp;transfer that to&nbsp;illustrator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’d have been my first step too to be honest. I may include this suggestions in the future.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The submissions I&nbsp;saw also had&nbsp;interesting methods of&nbsp;getting around the&nbsp;low pixel count&nbsp;maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s what I call creativity. Creativity is way more interesting when you have limitations.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>With no&nbsp;videos or&nbsp;quizzes this week, it&nbsp;was good to&nbsp;focus just on&nbsp;the pixel font assignment. As&nbsp;many of&nbsp;us have found out, it&nbsp;sounds like there is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;doing and&nbsp;redoing in&nbsp;this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s the design process.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week I&nbsp;learned that I&nbsp;need some peer support for&nbsp;feedback on&nbsp;my&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please do collaborate! But don’t forget I can help you during office hours. You can even come in groups to the office hours, and that has proved to be helpful in the past.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Are there any&nbsp;references you&nbsp;recommend if&nbsp;we want to&nbsp;learn more about typefaces/typeface&nbsp;design?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I am not an expert in typeface design. We’ll discuss typefaces in the next assignment. But if you that’s a career you want to pursue—and I don’t recommend it—, I may have some connections that could mentor you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I did&nbsp;not realize how&nbsp;difficult it&nbsp;is to&nbsp;keep all&nbsp;the letters cohesive and&nbsp;similar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Now imagine actually design a full typeface, with lowercase, uppercase, numbers, punctuation, all the glyphs. Then a full type family, with italics and weights…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For every assignment, is&nbsp;the first submission not&nbsp;counting to&nbsp;our actual grade? Or, was&nbsp;it just for&nbsp;this&nbsp;one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not all of them. I’ll let you know when the first draft is just a draft.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I would love to&nbsp;investigate how&nbsp;pixel text was&nbsp;used in&nbsp;the past and&nbsp;how it&nbsp;might still be&nbsp;used commonly today. One&nbsp;place that I&nbsp;have found pixel text was&nbsp;on Minecraft’s chat. I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;many video games use&nbsp;it, since it&nbsp;might carry less data or&nbsp;might simply go&nbsp;with their&nbsp;aesthetic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let us know what you find out!</p>

<hr />

<p  class="classjournal"><strong>New links on&nbsp;the class website.</strong></p>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks, David Lee.</p>
