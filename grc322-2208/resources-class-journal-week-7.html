<h1>Class journal, week 7  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Online classes have proven to&nbsp;be hard for&nbsp;me but&nbsp;at least we&nbsp;are approaching week 8. Thank you&nbsp;for being such an&nbsp;accommodating and&nbsp;supportive&nbsp;professor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s been hard on everybody. Thank you all for being such supportive students as well.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;for all&nbsp;of your help during office hours, I&nbsp;really appreciate your flexibility and&nbsp;feedback on&nbsp;assignments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I always enjoy helping during office hours. I miss the lab.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really enjoyed how&nbsp;this weeks video we&nbsp;could watch and&nbsp;follow along with it&nbsp;for our&nbsp;assignment. Felt more like an&nbsp;in person&nbsp;lab!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I would never be able to do such demo in person. It would take three hours to finish it. (Not that it didn’t take me way more than three hours to make the video, but it would be dreadful in person, especially for students.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found the&nbsp;type comparison posters more challenging or&nbsp;difficult than the&nbsp;typographer posters because there is&nbsp;so many more endless ways in&nbsp;explaining type comparison. I&nbsp;think because it&nbsp;involved more creativity, I&nbsp;found myself having higher expectations for&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is harder, of course.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;for giving us&nbsp;full credit for&nbsp;the first submission of&nbsp;the type comparison poster. It&nbsp;was week seven in&nbsp;a very hectic quarter, so&nbsp;catching a&nbsp;break was&nbsp;very nice. I&nbsp;am glad we&nbsp;will all&nbsp;still receive feedback for&nbsp;what we&nbsp;can improve on&nbsp;for the&nbsp;final&nbsp;draft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And the results were very good for a first round!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Understanding the&nbsp;table assignment seems like it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;very useful in&nbsp;a professional setting, I&nbsp;am glad to&nbsp;learn more about designing data to&nbsp;look&nbsp;nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, you can impress an employer in the future.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week is&nbsp;also the&nbsp;first time I’ve seen grep styles&nbsp;used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Stay tuned, then. It’ll get much more interesting.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>As stated before, I&nbsp;still have trouble with color theory. I&nbsp;will look into this on&nbsp;my own&nbsp;time&nbsp;soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The problem with color theory is that it’s not helpful. But there are several tools to help you pick a color palette. Even Pinterest or Google Images can be nice inspirations for color palettes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have to&nbsp;remember when doing the&nbsp;table assignment to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;overly creative and&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;making a&nbsp;clear and&nbsp;clean&nbsp;table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Absolutely.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In some textbooks I’ve seen columns separated by&nbsp;color. For&nbsp;example every other column was&nbsp;a block of&nbsp;gray from top&nbsp;to bottom. Based on&nbsp;the lecture video, is&nbsp;this not&nbsp;a good practice to&nbsp;follow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It depends. It’s usually very unnecessary and just adds noise. If the table is vey long and the columns too narrow, it can be helpful. But the type alignment is usually sufficient for the columns, leaving alternating grays for the rows.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Why is&nbsp;it never recommended to&nbsp;center your content in&nbsp;a column? If&nbsp;everything is&nbsp;centered, won’t there be&nbsp;good spacing between each&nbsp;column?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Because when you center, there’s no alignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;wondering if&nbsp;we will still have a&nbsp;midterm this quarter? I&nbsp;have not&nbsp;seen anything more about it&nbsp;on Canvas and&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;we would still be&nbsp;having&nbsp;one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. It’ll be a quiz during Thanksgiving break.</p>

  <p>This a link I believe is good for more tips and possibilities when designing tables: <a href="https://medium.com/design-with-figma/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-data-tables-7db29713a85a" target="_blank">https://medium.com/design-with-figma/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-data-tables-7db29713a85a</a></p>

<p  class="classjournal">ˆ Thanks, David. I really appreciate how you take the time to research each topic further. And I also appreciate, of course, you sharing you research back with us!</p>
