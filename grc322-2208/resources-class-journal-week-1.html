<h1>Class journals, week 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Can I&nbsp;just say&nbsp;how much I&nbsp;appreciate how&nbsp;your classes are&nbsp;formatted? Everything is&nbsp;planned out, there isn’t a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;busy-work, everything is&nbsp;concise and&nbsp;to the&nbsp;point, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like I’m prepared to&nbsp;take the&nbsp;class even though it’s only week one. :).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks, but like you said, it is only week 1. Please let me know if at some point things are not that great anymore</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;typography and&nbsp;printed type to&nbsp;be so&nbsp;precise and&nbsp;nicely condensed in&nbsp;the video! I&nbsp;think that it&nbsp;touched on&nbsp;many important points while not&nbsp;lingering too&nbsp;long on&nbsp;the&nbsp;details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always my goal with the videos.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The main point of&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;typography is&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;the democratization of&nbsp;information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;refreshing to&nbsp;watch the&nbsp;videos on&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;type, because although this is&nbsp;definitely not&nbsp;the first time we’ve all&nbsp;seen this information, it&nbsp;has been a&nbsp;while and&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good refresher (especially with how&nbsp;concise it&nbsp;was).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I figured it could be helpful to quickly refresh your mind. Also, I like to emphasize the point that technology is supposed to bring democratization of resources (such as information) instead of increasing the social gap.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The dot&nbsp;of the&nbsp;I&nbsp;is called a&nbsp;tittle (what a&nbsp;fun word).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is fun word, but if somebody at a party call it a dot, please let it go. Don’t be that person.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>While I&nbsp;learned typography terminology in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;my other classes, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;great refresher. I&nbsp;am glad that you&nbsp;mentioned the&nbsp;detailed terminology. I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;be familiarized with them enough to&nbsp;where I&nbsp;don’t have to&nbsp;be studying for&nbsp;a test to&nbsp;know those terms, but&nbsp;rather I&nbsp;use them as&nbsp;a tool to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;describe type and&nbsp;the effective use&nbsp;of those&nbsp;elements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The best way to learn any vocabulary is to use it them when you need it. It won’t be on the test, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;six-square height font, I&nbsp;have not&nbsp;figured out&nbsp;how to&nbsp;do a&nbsp;legible&nbsp;G. I think the hardest letters are the E and S. They both need a decent amount of squares to begin with just in order to make the letter form legible plus they have to be consistent with the other letters’ design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s the tough part of the 6-square font. The <code>e</code> and the <code>s</code> wouldn’t be so hard if it wasn’t for the descender of the <code>g</code>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For this assignment, I&nbsp;had difficulty knowing when to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;to the&nbsp;next letter/design and&nbsp;when to&nbsp;step away to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break since you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Very good points. Working on type design requires a lot of macro/micro shifting.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The pixel font assignment has&nbsp;been a&nbsp;good way&nbsp;to break down the&nbsp;structure of&nbsp;type and&nbsp;how the&nbsp;characters flow together. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;experiment more with hand lettering, I&nbsp;will think more critically about how&nbsp;color and&nbsp;structure impact the&nbsp;legibility and&nbsp;readability of&nbsp;a&nbsp;typeface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You got the learning objectives of the assignment exactly right.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The pixel project was&nbsp;initially frustrating because I&nbsp;felt very limited, especially working within a&nbsp;6 pixel height. I&nbsp;also found it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;know what was&nbsp;meant by&nbsp;adding two&nbsp;greys. I&nbsp;know that greys are&nbsp;typically used to&nbsp;soften curves but&nbsp;with a&nbsp;9 pixel height, it&nbsp;didn’t really soften anything so&nbsp;I&nbsp;opted to&nbsp;make shadows and&nbsp;“gradients.” I&nbsp;wish the&nbsp;instructions were a&nbsp;little clearer on&nbsp;that (maybe some examples?) but&nbsp;nonetheless, I’m still interested to&nbsp;see how&nbsp;I’ll edit these iterations&nbsp;further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You got it right on your first take. The grays are meant to soften the curve. I don’t like to give examples for this assignment because it leads to too much copying of the examples. But I agree that, since the class is online, the instructions could be more clear. I’ll clarify some points before the next submissions.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Since starting my&nbsp;internship and&nbsp;file prepping art&nbsp;from other designers, I&nbsp;have added a&nbsp;LOT more fonts to&nbsp;my library that I&nbsp;am excited to&nbsp;use. Any&nbsp;tips for&nbsp;organizing fonts/licenses (personal vs. commercial use)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I use Font Explorer, but because I got a license from Cal Poly. Not sure if there are more affordable alternatives. Please let us know if you find out.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;working on&nbsp;the UX/UI for&nbsp;a forum over the&nbsp;summer, and&nbsp;when it&nbsp;came time to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;typeface to&nbsp;use, it&nbsp;turned out&nbsp;to be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most difficult portions of&nbsp;the project because there are&nbsp;so many that look similar that it&nbsp;was hard to&nbsp;choose. I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;just takes a&nbsp;little more experience and&nbsp;practice but&nbsp;I&nbsp;still hope to&nbsp;learn about what goes into a&nbsp;typeface that makes it&nbsp;unique from&nbsp;others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, with experience, you will learn to pay attention to details.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I would love to&nbsp;investigate typography of&nbsp;non-latin characters. I&nbsp;think that there are&nbsp;worlds of&nbsp;design that I&nbsp;don’t have access to&nbsp;because of&nbsp;language barriers. Studying character based languages and&nbsp;the typography associated with them would be&nbsp;cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Oh, tell me about it. I wish I knew other languages just so I could appreciate other kinds of typeface design. It’s really hard to appreciate their efficacy without any context of the language. I just find them beautiful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Met with Bruno to&nbsp;discuss Pixel Font requirements, but&nbsp;gained a&nbsp;stronger understanding on&nbsp;the values of&nbsp;legibility, consistency, and&nbsp;readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I highly recommend meeting with me during my office hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There is&nbsp;also this pretty cool video game called&nbsp;Type:Rider and&nbsp;it’s literally a&nbsp;game where you&nbsp;play as&nbsp;a colon and&nbsp;go through different historical periods based on&nbsp;the type of&nbsp;that time period. It’s pretty cheap as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;games go, and&nbsp;really&nbsp;awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I haven’t heard of it before. I’ll take a look.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have four classes this quarter that require journals every Sunday (including 429), so&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of reflection. I&nbsp;find them helpful, though, for&nbsp;when I&nbsp;have questions or&nbsp;when other’s responses are&nbsp;anonymously posted for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">More journals? I’d like to know more about them.</p>
