<h1>Instructions for&nbsp;Module 5  </h1>

<p>Hello everybody, I <em>forgot</em> to mention that I would be out of town for this week’s&nbsp;lab. </p>

<p>Please follow the <strong>seating chart</strong> and sign the <strong>sign-in sheet</strong>.</p>

<p>Then, proceed to work on the design principles as you do every week.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Design principles tips  </h2>

<p>Since I’m not in the lab to help you, <del>you may want to</del> please follow these tips:</p>

<h3>Mental model</h3>

<p>It’s very similar to external consistency. But it builds upon previous user’s knowledge to help with usability. Good examples, digital or physical, are products that have no instructions and wouldn’t be too intuitive to use if you haven’t seen and used similar products before. Alternatively, you can find examples that uses the user’s muscle memory to position controls; that’s mental model too.</p>

<h3>Von Restorff effect</h3>

<p>Have you seen anyone wearing a navy t&#8209;shirt on campus today? You wouldn’t be able to tell for sure, would you? How about someone dressed up as a circus clown? I’m sure you would remember that because “noticeably different things are more likely to be recalled than common things”.</p>

<h3>Expectation&nbsp;effect</h3>

<p>The way one sees objects, buildings, services change their expectations. Depending on the branding, products can be perceived as healthier, or faster, cheaper, fancier, safer, whatever. Depending on your audience, you want to make it look and feel in a specific way. (<strong>Audience does <em>not</em> mean demographics.</strong> It can be context. What would someone look for that would make them choose one product versus another? Sometimes, I want fancy chocolate; sometimes, all I want is a candy bar. I don’t change my age, my gender identification, or my income when I choose one versus another. It depends on the context.)</p>

<h3>Horror vacui</h3>

<p>Submission should be a little different for this principle. You want to submit <strong>two&nbsp;physical</strong> and <strong>two&nbsp;website</strong> examples. You want, then, to demonstrate the correlation of empty space and value perception. </p>

<hr />

<h2>Website proposal tips  </h2>

<p>The instructions are on Canvas.</p>

<p>Here are the main mistakes from previous years:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To forget to include your name on the title element in the head of the document.</p></li>
<li><p>Not to include all the content for each page.</p></li>
<li><p>Fail to include the image descriptions. (Or include “photo of” or “image of”. You don’t need that, just describe the image, as an <code>alt</code> attribute.)</p></li>
<li><p>Not to describe audience to <em>their</em> goals and desires. (Don’t make restrictive, unhelpful assumptions on your audience’s age or other demographics. And don’t list your goals.)</p></li>
<li><p>Too many typos.</p></li>
<li><p>Fail to include the alt attribute for the screen shots.</p></li>
<li><p>Fail to include <em>good</em> references for good visual language.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Don’t forget to submit your <strong>midterm</strong> if you haven’t yet!</p>

<p>And don’t forget to submit your journals.</p>

<p>This week, I won’t be able to publish the journal highlights or the design principles analysis on Friday. They will be published next week.</p>

<p>But <strong>module 6</strong> will be open on Friday as usual.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p class="disclaimer">We all make mistakes, and I&nbsp;appreciate if&nbsp;you&nbsp;let&nbsp;me know when you&nbsp;catch any&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;several mistakes I’ll&nbsp;make this quarter. Students who&nbsp;find insconsistent dates or&nbsp;instructions on&nbsp;any&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;assignments will&nbsp;be&nbsp;rewarded with&nbsp;candy.</p>
