<h1>Homework (week 1)  </h1>

<p><em>I believe that coming up with an idea for the project is the biggest challenge in this course. That’s why we have this homework activity. It will be graded as if it was the report update for week 1.</em></p>

<p>In this course, you will work for 10 weeks on the same project. It can be a web service, a smartphone app, a kiosk interface, or anything that has a visual interaction interface for the final user to interact with. (You don’t need, however, to limit yourself to devices you already own or know.)</p>

<p>Think about emerging technology, even if it’s not feasible commercially. (Tele-transportation is off-limits, but wireless electricity is fair game.) Here are some ideas for emerging technology you can work with. You may, of course, combine more than one item from the list.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ultra fast wireless internet</strong> <br />
Think 100TB/s or more.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wireless electricity</strong> <br />
Not only at home or at work, but on the streets, everywhere.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-driven cars</strong> <br />
What are the possibilities beyond checking Facebook while commuting?  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wearable devices of all kinds</strong> <br />
Not only glasses or watches. Think about necklesses, rings, shoes, whatever…  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smart home</strong> <br />
What if everything at your home was connected to the internet?  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Augmented reality</strong> <br />
How technology can give us the information that we need on each context?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, take a look on the following videos for inspiration:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPqSS7reck">Coin, one card to rule them all, 2013</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXfWFQ36thE">Apple iPhone 6 ad Apple Pay, 2015</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eob532iEpqk">IBM RFID Commercial - The Future Market, 2006</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1L3o88GKew">Lockitron - Keyless Entry Using Your Phone, 2012</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr-zHSsxP7s">Pizza Hut Interactive Table, 2014</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQv74J7oSk">Microsoft HoloLens Demonstration, 2015</a></p>

<p><em>(I have shown these videos to my students too many times. Let me know if you have suggestions.)</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Come up with <strong>12 to 20 ideas</strong>. Think about different devices, scales, and kinds of product. Think about your own interests as well as other people’s (travel, sports, studies, music, camping, etc.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Submit your ideas on <strong>PolyLearn</strong> (as plain text) and bring <strong><em>two</em> hard copies to&nbsp;class</strong> to your lab in week 2. (April 8th or 10th.)</p>
