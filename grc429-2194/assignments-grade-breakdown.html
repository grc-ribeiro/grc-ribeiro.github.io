<h1>Grade breakdown  </h1>

<h3>Project documentation: 60%</h3>

<p>Every week—from week&nbsp;2 to finals week— you will be required to bring an updated version of&nbsp;your report. On finals week, you will also deliver a final presentation on the day of our finals. Those are the only assignments for this class. Your report will be graded weekly, and in each week the grade will receive a greater weight. In the second week, it will weigh&nbsp;2; in the third week, it will weight&nbsp;3, and so on, until finals week, when your final presentation will&nbsp;weigh&nbsp;11. (The project idea in the first week of class is the first step in the project documentation, and it weighs 1.)</p>

<h3>Exams: 30%</h3>

<p>Midterm exam: 30% <br />
Final exam: 70%</p>

<h3>Class journal: 10%</h3>

<p>At the end of every week of class, you need to write a brief journal entry on PolyLearn. It&nbsp;should not take you more than five minutes, though.</p>
