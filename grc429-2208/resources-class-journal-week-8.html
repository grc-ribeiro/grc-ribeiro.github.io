<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;8  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m worried about this project/case study because it’s so&nbsp;conceptual, not&nbsp;sure if&nbsp;employers will even like this type of&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve said it&nbsp;many times, this is&nbsp;the project that gives my&nbsp;students a&nbsp;job. It’s not&nbsp;conceptual at&nbsp;all. The&nbsp;process is&nbsp;all there. And&nbsp;employers will appreciate not&nbsp;seeing at&nbsp;yet another recipe app&nbsp;for the&nbsp;iPhone.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I know you&nbsp;mentioned that people get&nbsp;jobs because of&nbsp;the project in&nbsp;this class. Do&nbsp;you think people put&nbsp;the entire report in&nbsp;their portfolios or&nbsp;just talk about the&nbsp;project/process in&nbsp;interviews?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They don’t put&nbsp;the whole report in&nbsp;their portfolios. They show the&nbsp;project and&nbsp;some process and&nbsp;they talk about it&nbsp;in interviews. This project get&nbsp;students jobs, <em>after</em> they got&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bouncing off&nbsp;that last point, this project hasn’t been a&nbsp;huge stresser in&nbsp;my school life. Sometimes final projects can&nbsp;be daunting especially if&nbsp;they aren’t started in&nbsp;advance, so&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;this project has&nbsp;really&nbsp;helped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I always tell my&nbsp;students that this is&nbsp;the least class they will take with me. They never believe in&nbsp;the&nbsp;beginning.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I liked that we&nbsp;were separated from our&nbsp;group members for&nbsp;the ethical considerations assignment because it&nbsp;gave us&nbsp;all a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with ideas totally independently and&nbsp;get many people’s feedback, so&nbsp;we were able to&nbsp;combine so&nbsp;many good ideas that no&nbsp;one person would have thought of&nbsp;on their&nbsp;own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That was&nbsp;the idea. I’m really glad it&nbsp;worked&nbsp;well.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Will discussions be&nbsp;incorporated into the&nbsp;next few&nbsp;steps of&nbsp;our project? I&nbsp;found the&nbsp;feedback from people to&nbsp;be pretty&nbsp;useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad it&nbsp;worked so&nbsp;well. Honestly, I&nbsp;wasn’t so&nbsp;sure. But&nbsp;that’s it, we’re almost done&nbsp;here.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>A few&nbsp;people in&nbsp;last week’s journals mentioned how&nbsp;great Adobe&nbsp;XD&nbsp;is. I&nbsp;was introduced to&nbsp;it in&nbsp;a class over the&nbsp;summer and&nbsp;loved it. It’s so&nbsp;sleek and&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;without much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;learning curve, and&nbsp;the prototyping aspect is&nbsp;fun. :D</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I find all&nbsp;those tools (Adobe&nbsp;XD, Figma, Sketch, etc.) quite intuitive and&nbsp;super fun&nbsp;to make interactive mock&#8209;ups.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;nice image to&nbsp;go with our&nbsp;abstract, does it&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be an&nbsp;image we&nbsp;create?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. It’s an&nbsp;image of&nbsp;your product and&nbsp;its&nbsp;interface.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I love being able to&nbsp;see the&nbsp;progress our&nbsp;group makes every week through the&nbsp;report updates. The&nbsp;report updates each week has&nbsp;made the&nbsp;project very&nbsp;manageable!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">So many of&nbsp;you wrote similar thoughts this week. I’m glad you’re all&nbsp;enjoying the&nbsp;class.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I liked working individually, and&nbsp;then meeting with my&nbsp;group later in&nbsp;the week to&nbsp;hear their ideas. It&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;time to&nbsp;really consider our&nbsp;project. My&nbsp;group mates thought of&nbsp;ideas I&nbsp;never would have&nbsp;considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Best way&nbsp;to collaborate. It’s almost like you&nbsp;are also enrolled in&nbsp;GRC&nbsp;322.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Going from the&nbsp;wireframes to&nbsp;the high definition layouts made a&nbsp;huge difference. Usability analysis testing the&nbsp;wireframes was&nbsp;a good idea because it’s not&nbsp;set in&nbsp;stone&nbsp;yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And they communicate it&nbsp;well&nbsp;too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Color schemes are&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;decide on&nbsp;than I&nbsp;thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They’re hard. Between only you&nbsp;and me, it’s my&nbsp;least favorite part of&nbsp;any design&nbsp;project.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For my&nbsp;project, my&nbsp;group looked more into Apple’s app&nbsp;specifications and&nbsp;made our&nbsp;layout to&nbsp;be more compliant with their specifications. One&nbsp;big takeaway that we&nbsp;had was&nbsp;we made edits to&nbsp;our icons to&nbsp;make them look more like what Apple uses. We&nbsp;hope this will create a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;familiarity with those who&nbsp;use our&nbsp;app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sounds like a&nbsp;good&nbsp;strategy</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have done a&nbsp;few GRC&nbsp;projects about product and&nbsp;app development, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;have never been tasked to&nbsp;do ethical considerations until&nbsp;now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad you&nbsp;did,&nbsp;then.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really enjoyed thinking about the&nbsp;ethics of&nbsp;our product this week, it&nbsp;makes you&nbsp;think about how&nbsp;many other companies ignored ethics when making decisions about how&nbsp;their products would affect the&nbsp;environment or&nbsp;people’s&nbsp;health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sadly,&nbsp;true.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Is there any&nbsp;one ethical approach we&nbsp;should focus on&nbsp;within the&nbsp;five sources of&nbsp;ethical standards? Or&nbsp;are they all&nbsp;correct in&nbsp;one way&nbsp;or&nbsp;another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They are&nbsp;all valid lens to&nbsp;look through. And&nbsp;more often than not, they lead to&nbsp;the same&nbsp;conclusion.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Just wondering, but&nbsp;at the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;the project could we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;discussion board where people post some of&nbsp;their high fidelity mockups or&nbsp;images? I’m just super curious as&nbsp;to what everyone decided to&nbsp;do since the&nbsp;two projects I&nbsp;read about in&nbsp;my discussion board were so&nbsp;creative and&nbsp;cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good idea! Let’s do&nbsp;this. I&nbsp;usually have a&nbsp;final presentation in&nbsp;class. But&nbsp;for this year, a&nbsp;discussion board seems to&nbsp;be the&nbsp;best&nbsp;option.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This isn’t entirely on&nbsp;you but&nbsp;since my&nbsp;other projects in&nbsp;GrC are&nbsp;also UI&nbsp;concepts, I’m getting so&nbsp;burnt out&nbsp;on working in&nbsp;Figma. Have any&nbsp;advice for&nbsp;dealing with burnout when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;design&nbsp;work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Go out&nbsp;for some physical activity. Swimming, running, and&nbsp;soccer are&nbsp;my preferred workouts, but&nbsp;you choose the&nbsp;one that relaxes you&nbsp;the&nbsp;most.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This is&nbsp;somewhat irrelevant, but&nbsp;the political anxiety surrounding the&nbsp;election definitely made me&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the effects of&nbsp;politics on&nbsp;various aspects of&nbsp;life, including business and&nbsp;travel–something that my&nbsp;product is&nbsp;affected&nbsp;by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not irrelevant at&nbsp;all. Politics affect everything. I&nbsp;believe you&nbsp;mention political anxiety because of&nbsp;the presidential election. But&nbsp;please always do&nbsp;your homework on&nbsp;local elections too, including all&nbsp;the propositions. (Those seem to&nbsp;be the&nbsp;hardest to&nbsp;decide on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;vote, but&nbsp;your vote counts, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;know your generation really cares. Better than your generation, only the&nbsp;ones that will come&nbsp;next!)</p>
