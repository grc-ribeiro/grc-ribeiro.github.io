<h1>Class journal, week 2  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The expectation effect clearly extends beyond just design. What really stuck with me&nbsp;was the&nbsp;Rosenthal Effect, where teachers treat students differently based on&nbsp;how they are&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;perform. It&nbsp;is through this effect, mixed in&nbsp;with an&nbsp;instructor’s inherent biases and&nbsp;prejudices that lead to&nbsp;hostile classrooms for&nbsp;some students, especially Black and&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. That’s also true. Instructors’ biases can lead to failing students without being the students’ fault.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>So I&nbsp;thought these were due&nbsp;on Fridays so&nbsp;I&nbsp;freaked out&nbsp;because I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;forgot to&nbsp;fill this out&nbsp;yesterday, was&nbsp;in the&nbsp;outdoors where I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;reception, and&nbsp;saw that you&nbsp;sent me&nbsp;an email… took me&nbsp;a half hour of&nbsp;hiking to&nbsp;download the&nbsp;contents of&nbsp;the message and&nbsp;realize you’d sent me&nbsp;an email about the&nbsp;initial class survey. Oh&nbsp;man was&nbsp;that&nbsp;stressful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">OK. There are two things that I did this week that I don’t want to happen again. I’ll try to avoid emailing you during the weekend and the grades for the report won’t be posted until Monday or Tuesday. (I submitted them on Sunday, but tried to set that they wouldn’t post until Monday. It won’t happen again.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The biggest takeaway from this week is&nbsp;how to&nbsp;use variables on&nbsp;InDesign, I&nbsp;can’t believe I&nbsp;hadn’t used them before but&nbsp;for our&nbsp;report update from this week I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;learn&nbsp;how.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s a specific use, but when it becomes helpful in a future project, it can be really helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week I&nbsp;have learned that Adobe XD&nbsp;is useful software to&nbsp;utilize for&nbsp;wireframing and&nbsp;interactivity. Moving forward we&nbsp;plan on&nbsp;learning how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;Adobe XD&nbsp;to sort of&nbsp;build our&nbsp;Augmented Reality&nbsp;application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’re not there yet, but it’ll be helpful in few weeks.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Our next step of&nbsp;our project is&nbsp;to start working on&nbsp;wireframes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Nope! Not even close.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Next steps will be&nbsp;to creating good interview questions to&nbsp;gather user&nbsp;research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Abstracts should cover the&nbsp;scope of&nbsp;your project and&nbsp;what it&nbsp;does, not&nbsp;your processes in&nbsp;creating&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It actually depends, but in the context of this class and this report, yes, that’s how you write your report.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;confused about the&nbsp;table of&nbsp;content that we&nbsp;are supposed to&nbsp;edit in&nbsp;InDesign, are&nbsp;we supposed to&nbsp;edit the&nbsp;pages and&nbsp;theme?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">No. Just select it and click on <code>Layout &gt; Update Table Of Contents</code>, as the instructions say.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">I think I'm starting to get a better sense of what this AR project is going to be like. I'm glad it's a project that stretches over the quarter so I feel like I have enough time to actually appreciate it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that when writing about your target audience, you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;avoid adding aspects such as&nbsp;gender and&nbsp;age (if they are&nbsp;irrelevant to&nbsp;your product). You&nbsp;want to&nbsp;keep your target audience broad that way&nbsp;many people feel like they can&nbsp;use your&nbsp;product!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It doesn’t even need to be broad. If you’re designing for waterpolo coaches, that’s a very specific audience. But their age, gender, etc. will vary.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like that specific sections of&nbsp;the final report are&nbsp;due week by&nbsp;week because it&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;keep us&nbsp;accountable on&nbsp;the final assignment instead of&nbsp;cramming it&nbsp;all in&nbsp;during week&nbsp;10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Can you imagine if I gave you all the tools and said “I see you in ten weeks!”? It’d not go well. Also, by the end of the quarter, you will look at this big document and be surprised by how much you did without being overwhelmed. That’s the beauty of GRC&nbsp;429.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;interested to&nbsp;learn that the&nbsp;audience does not&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be defined by&nbsp;demographic, but&nbsp;rather context - that has&nbsp;always been a&nbsp;more logical process to&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">People in the same demographics can be very different. But people with a common interest can be more similar, at least on the behavior towards that common interest.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with our&nbsp;product name but&nbsp;when we&nbsp;found one&nbsp;it made us&nbsp;very excited for&nbsp;our&nbsp;project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Don’t worry too much about the name.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s been interesting researching cooking apps and&nbsp;seeing what’s resources are&nbsp;available on&nbsp;the market for&nbsp;those who&nbsp;like to&nbsp;cook. Majority of the audience is women so targeting our app towards them is something to consider. We also want to target younger people who are interested in learning to cook so learning what appeals to them is something we're looking into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">No. Please go back and watch the video about audience again.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The only thing that has&nbsp;remained confusing is&nbsp;our final deliverable, will it&nbsp;be an&nbsp;app interface, working AR, a&nbsp;visualization of&nbsp;what the&nbsp;AR would look like, or&nbsp;a mix&nbsp;of&nbsp;these?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Just kidding, it’ll probably more just a visualization of the AR. I’ve had working AR prototypes in the past, but I think it’ll be hard to pull that off this quarter, because 2020.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Writing out&nbsp;the schedule in&nbsp;the report was&nbsp;helpful because now&nbsp;we are&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;when we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the&nbsp;project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And you can always revisit it, like everything else on your report.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think I’m just recently realizing how&nbsp;design principles are&nbsp;also applicable as&nbsp;UX/design and&nbsp;that I&nbsp;know more about UX/UI than I&nbsp;previously thought and&nbsp;that’s a&nbsp;nice feeling :).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I guess I tricked you in learning something you didn’t know you were learning in GRC 338.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also want to&nbsp;better understand the&nbsp;way that AR&nbsp;glasses work with being paired to&nbsp;an&nbsp;app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We don’t know exactly how it’s going to work, but that’s fine. It’s a detail that can be left out of the scope of this project.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;learn more about Augmented Reality applications are&nbsp;being developed&nbsp;today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please share.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Do you&nbsp;think using AR&nbsp;in public will become a&nbsp;lot more common&nbsp;soon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I do. But hopefully not obnoxiously like it was the case with Google Glass, when people were just supposed to wear them for anything and everything. But I do think they can be helpful in specific contexts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Once AR/Hologram becomes more developed, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;strange to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a world were most things in&nbsp;our daily lives are&nbsp;no longer physically&nbsp;real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I believe objects related to food or transportation will still have to be real. But we may not need screens, and I’m fine with that.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p><strong>New links on&nbsp;the class website.</strong></p>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks to Yenna&nbsp;Chen&nbsp;Chen, Yeyoung&nbsp;Kim, Trucdan&nbsp;Nguyen, Karla&nbsp;Tu, and Helen&nbsp;Wong. </p>
