<h1>Class journal, week 7  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>While I&nbsp;like the&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;limitless possibilities in&nbsp;the class, sometimes I&nbsp;feel my&nbsp;concepts are&nbsp;not grounded in&nbsp;reality. But&nbsp;rather a&nbsp;movie reality. The&nbsp;technology we&nbsp;have just isn’t quite good enough for&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the features I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;have implemented into this application. While I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;will eventually advance to&nbsp;the point that this tech should be&nbsp;available, it&nbsp;still feels a&nbsp;bit far&nbsp;fetched&nbsp;currently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And that’s what makes it more interesting than most projects a potential employer sees in interviews.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I can’t believe this was&nbsp;our last video/quiz. I&nbsp;hope we&nbsp;are not&nbsp;completely on&nbsp;our own&nbsp;for figuring out&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the&nbsp;report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There isn’t much left. But I have office hours every day, you know.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The usability tests were very helpful for&nbsp;our product. We&nbsp;wondered if&nbsp;the swipe mechanism was&nbsp;going to&nbsp;work well, and&nbsp;the test proved that it&nbsp;didn’t. Instead, we&nbsp;found that the&nbsp;users liked to&nbsp;click the&nbsp;buttons instead, so&nbsp;we made a&nbsp;button that said “Next” instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;swipe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The problem with swiping is guessability. Hard to know it’s there.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>How do&nbsp;we fix&nbsp;our table of&nbsp;contents when the&nbsp;pages do&nbsp;not link to&nbsp;one&nbsp;another?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Make sure you’re using the proper paragraph styles. Then select the ToC and update it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I actually had&nbsp;a conversation with someone the&nbsp;other day&nbsp;about thispersondoesnotexist.com. They were a&nbsp;little weirded out&nbsp;by the&nbsp;website and&nbsp;I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I&nbsp;was told about it&nbsp;in class and&nbsp;how it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;used for&nbsp;personas and&nbsp;he was&nbsp;really interested in&nbsp;that because he&nbsp;would’ve never thought of&nbsp;that being a&nbsp;use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I was weird out by it the first time I saw it too. But students were using it for personas, and I thought it made perfect sense.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Prototyping on&nbsp;Adobe XD&nbsp;is a&nbsp;new skill that I&nbsp;have recently&nbsp;learned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s rather fun, isn’t it? Quite simple and effective.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Adobe XD&nbsp;is my&nbsp;new favorite program. Prototyping is&nbsp;still something I’m learning but&nbsp;they make it&nbsp;really easy to&nbsp;do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">All these prototyping tools are quite fun to use.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Breaking down the&nbsp;steps of&nbsp;the process week by&nbsp;week has&nbsp;made everything much more manageable and&nbsp;gives a&nbsp;great perspective on&nbsp;progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s the design process.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Crazy how&nbsp;fast this quarter is&nbsp;going! I&nbsp;cant believe our&nbsp;project for&nbsp;this quarter is&nbsp;wrapping up. Honestly its&nbsp;been such a&nbsp;relief that we’ve taken each piece of&nbsp;the project week by&nbsp;week and&nbsp;it would’ve been so&nbsp;overwhelming if&nbsp;it was&nbsp;all assigned at&nbsp;the&nbsp;beginning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">But if you think about it, it was all assigned in the beginning, since the page with all the steps and deadlines was already up. We just have weekly milestones to achieve. In the future, make sure to break projects in milestones if they’re not broken for you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I wonder if&nbsp;we will end&nbsp;up with a&nbsp;booklet for&nbsp;the final product. Do&nbsp;we have to&nbsp;redesign our&nbsp;report to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;prettier?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">No. The report is the final product.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week our&nbsp;grade in&nbsp;the class dropped quite a&nbsp;bit which made me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;teammates quite&nbsp;nervous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Every week, the weigh of the grade is a little higher, making it easier to recover in the end.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When should we&nbsp;update our&nbsp;abstract from the&nbsp;first few&nbsp;weeks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Whenever you feel it needs to be updated.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think I&nbsp;am struggling to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;typeface I&nbsp;absolutely love. Is&nbsp;it better to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;logo for&nbsp;our app&nbsp;or just use&nbsp;a different typeface for&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the&nbsp;app?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Don’t spend too long on the logo.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I used Gill Sans for&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the layouts…then read your comment about that typeface in&nbsp;322 and&nbsp;researching the&nbsp;designer…so I&nbsp;looked him&nbsp;up and&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I’m going to&nbsp;change the&nbsp;typeface for&nbsp;next week’s turn-in because ummmmmmmmm… :o</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I would.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My group didnt get&nbsp;much feedback from the&nbsp;usability analysis test so&nbsp;maybe we&nbsp;didnt ask&nbsp;them to&nbsp;do the&nbsp;best&nbsp;tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You don’t want feedback from the test. It’s a test. You want to test your product for usability.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Creating the&nbsp;UI design was&nbsp;a fun&nbsp;process, I&nbsp;realized that if&nbsp;you don’t get&nbsp;inspiration from other existing apps and&nbsp;websites, the&nbsp;user will find the&nbsp;interface confusing because it’s a&nbsp;completely new&nbsp;design and&nbsp;they will be&nbsp;confused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Mental models.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Icon is&nbsp;used for&nbsp;recognition, but&nbsp;the name is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;avoid potential confusion or&nbsp;misinterpretation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Exactly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Placebo effect is&nbsp;real, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not even an opinion. It has been proved by science.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I looked ahead to&nbsp;week 8. Based on&nbsp;my personal definition of&nbsp;“ethical considerations,” I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;think our&nbsp;project will have too&nbsp;many to&nbsp;consider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Make sure to read the articles and participate in the discussions, then.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m looking forward to&nbsp;choosing a&nbsp;final design for&nbsp;the product! Also with all&nbsp;these report updates, I&nbsp;think this will be&nbsp;a great portfolio piece because there’s so&nbsp;much content showing ideation and&nbsp;the&nbsp;process!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve said it before. This is the project that you’ll use to get a job.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>If anyone is&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;UI/UX, check out&nbsp;the upcoming Adobe+MTV Creative Jam&nbsp;competition! Teams of&nbsp;2 create an&nbsp;app using Adobe XD&nbsp;over the&nbsp;course of&nbsp;a week.
