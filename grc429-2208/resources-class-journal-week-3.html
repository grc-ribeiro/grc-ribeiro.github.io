<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;3  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This class is&nbsp;very good practical experience for&nbsp;learning how&nbsp;to design/develop a&nbsp;new&nbsp;product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s almost like I&nbsp;know what I’m&nbsp;doing.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;one very tired college student. Your assignments aren’t a&nbsp;very heavy weight on&nbsp;my shoulders but&nbsp;I&nbsp;genuinely wish other professors didn’t think that being home for&nbsp;school meant that we&nbsp;magically had&nbsp;more time to&nbsp;do busywork (aka read 10&nbsp;articles, watch 5&nbsp;YouTube videos, listen to&nbsp;3 podcasts, and&nbsp;100 pages in&nbsp;a textbook) each week. I&nbsp;really just need more hours in&nbsp;the day&nbsp;and more brainpower to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;give at&nbsp;this&nbsp;point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">No busy work from me. If&nbsp;you ever feel like you’re “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqGcn3m3g3o">waxing on&nbsp;and waxing off</a>”, let&nbsp;me know. There’s nothing more frustrating and&nbsp;therefore ineffective for&nbsp;the students than the&nbsp;feeling that you’re doing busy work. It&nbsp;may work in&nbsp;Hollywood, but&nbsp;in real life, you&nbsp;check out&nbsp;and stop&nbsp;learning.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like that we&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have too&nbsp;much more going on&nbsp;in this class so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;can focus on&nbsp;our&nbsp;project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve said it&nbsp;many times, this class goes really smoothly. By&nbsp;the end&nbsp;of ten&nbsp;weeks, you’ll be&nbsp;surprised by&nbsp;how much you&nbsp;have accomplished and&nbsp;learned compared to&nbsp;how little effort it&nbsp;felt.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>From this instance, I&nbsp;learned that I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;online resources and&nbsp;be proactive in&nbsp;asking for&nbsp;help before the&nbsp;due date of&nbsp;an assignment. I&nbsp;will be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;do this moving forward so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;do not&nbsp;make any&nbsp;more&nbsp;mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sounds like a&nbsp;plan.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Sending you&nbsp;our questions was&nbsp;a great suggestion you&nbsp;had and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am glad we&nbsp;followed that&nbsp;suggestion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I am&nbsp;too. My&nbsp;job is&nbsp;literally to&nbsp;help&nbsp;you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I thought this weeks quiz questions were confusing— not&nbsp;all of&nbsp;them but&nbsp;I&nbsp;remember I&nbsp;struggled with one&nbsp;on each of&nbsp;the 5&nbsp;questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The goal of&nbsp;the quizzes is&nbsp;not for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;assess if&nbsp;you watched the&nbsp;videos, but&nbsp;to make you&nbsp;learn a&nbsp;little more and&nbsp;feel prepared. In&nbsp;a 400&#8209;level class and&nbsp;three chances to&nbsp;get the&nbsp;answers right, it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;too straightforward; that would be&nbsp;insulting even. With that said, they’re not&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be confusing. When you&nbsp;find a&nbsp;question that you&nbsp;don’t understand please screenshot it&nbsp;and let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;having trouble figuring out&nbsp;how to&nbsp;edit things on&nbsp;the variables page. Can&nbsp;I&nbsp;edit things like spacing? If&nbsp;I&nbsp;still can’t figure it&nbsp;out, I&nbsp;will probably attend one&nbsp;of your office&nbsp;hours!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m here every&nbsp;day.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m glad we&nbsp;got to&nbsp;do a&nbsp;moodboard kind of&nbsp;thing in&nbsp;the report. I’m slightly addicted to&nbsp;moodboards and&nbsp;Pinterest is&nbsp;my best&nbsp;friend. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Pinterest is&nbsp;a great tool to&nbsp;<em>save</em> your visual language references. But&nbsp;it’s terrible to&nbsp;<em>look for</em> references. Look for&nbsp;them in&nbsp;credible sources and&nbsp;save them on&nbsp;your Pinterest&nbsp;board.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Sometimes I&nbsp;think the&nbsp;formatting on&nbsp;InDesign is&nbsp;very confusing because it&nbsp;won’t let&nbsp;me do&nbsp;certain&nbsp;functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sounds like you&nbsp;could use&nbsp;some help in&nbsp;my office&nbsp;hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The TOC&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of trouble this time, I’m not&nbsp;sure why&nbsp;when I&nbsp;kept updating, some parts of&nbsp;the TOC&nbsp;would disappear or&nbsp;it would be&nbsp;replaced by&nbsp;a part of&nbsp;the paragraph text from the&nbsp;page that I&nbsp;was referring to. I&nbsp;double checked my&nbsp;paragraph styles, and&nbsp;it all&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;be correct, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;wasn’t sure what was&nbsp;going&nbsp;on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sounds like you&nbsp;could use&nbsp;some help in&nbsp;my office&nbsp;hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>After we&nbsp;do short interviews, If&nbsp;we get&nbsp;information that maybe hints that our&nbsp;product is&nbsp;not helpful, do&nbsp;you suggest we&nbsp;change the&nbsp;concept? Ex: sports glasses to&nbsp;an&nbsp;app?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Your product is&nbsp;useful and&nbsp;helpful. Find out&nbsp;what users need help with and&nbsp;help them with what they&nbsp;need.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Next steps will mainly be&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;making revisions to&nbsp;what we&nbsp;have already turned in&nbsp;and branding guidelines and&nbsp;wireframes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Inaccurate.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The next step on&nbsp;our project is&nbsp;to schedule interviews and&nbsp;to develop our&nbsp;persona.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Accurate.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Alright, so&nbsp;for the&nbsp;final product that goes with the&nbsp;report we’re focusing more on&nbsp;designing the&nbsp;app/product and&nbsp;making mockups and&nbsp;such rather than actually developing any&nbsp;AR, correct? I&nbsp;was still a&nbsp;little confused on&nbsp;that but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think someone in&nbsp;last week’s journal said that’s what we’re going&nbsp;for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s&nbsp;correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>At this point my&nbsp;group has&nbsp;a great working rhythm. We&nbsp;have been meeting monday, tuesday, and&nbsp;wednesday each week to&nbsp;prepare our&nbsp;report. I’m excited to&nbsp;work with them&nbsp;further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s great to&nbsp;hear, but&nbsp;I won’t assume it’s working that well for&nbsp;everybody. If&nbsp;you’re having problems with your group, you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;know sooner rather than&nbsp;later.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I can’t imagine doing the&nbsp;group project alone. My&nbsp;group and&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been doing really well because we&nbsp;bounce ideas off&nbsp;each other, and&nbsp;we can&nbsp;ask each other questions if&nbsp;we are&nbsp;confused about&nbsp;anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The experience is&nbsp;much better, I&nbsp;agree.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>How should we&nbsp;go about finding people to&nbsp;interview?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Email people you&nbsp;know. Email people you&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really had&nbsp;to think while writing the&nbsp;research questions because they need to&nbsp;be phrased in&nbsp;a way&nbsp;that doesn’t imply a&nbsp;certain answer, while letting the&nbsp;user tell a&nbsp;story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is&nbsp;trickier than it&nbsp;first seems, but&nbsp;most of&nbsp;you did&nbsp;a great&nbsp;job.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m not&nbsp;sure the&nbsp;questions we&nbsp;are asking are&nbsp;to a&nbsp;general audience, or&nbsp;to experts in&nbsp;the field of&nbsp;AR development. From what I&nbsp;learned from the&nbsp;videos, I’m guessing it’s the&nbsp;expert, but&nbsp;there are&nbsp;questions that my&nbsp;group is&nbsp;asking that would be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;a public&nbsp;survey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’re interviewing potential users, not&nbsp;experts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Looks like from here, we&nbsp;just have to&nbsp;conduct the&nbsp;interviews. I’m guessing there’s going to&nbsp;be instructions on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;get interview subjects? It’s going to&nbsp;be very difficult to&nbsp;interview people when we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;social&nbsp;distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Zoom will have to&nbsp;do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One question that I&nbsp;still have is– when we&nbsp;are conducting interviews for&nbsp;this project, is&nbsp;it okay to&nbsp;do them over Zoom (and not&nbsp;in the&nbsp;natural environment) due&nbsp;to the&nbsp;current&nbsp;pandemic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, it&nbsp;is 2020. Zoom is&nbsp;fine.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The next steps of&nbsp;our project includes interviewing people. We&nbsp;are trying to&nbsp;find the&nbsp;most efficient way&nbsp;to conduct these interviews. Most likely, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;through&nbsp;Zoom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Unfortunately,&nbsp;yes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This made me&nbsp;think of&nbsp;a case study from GrC&nbsp;320 where a&nbsp;fast food company tried to&nbsp;improve milkshake sales by&nbsp;asking people who&nbsp;fit the&nbsp;demographic they expected of&nbsp;people that enjoyed milkshakes to&nbsp;describe the&nbsp;perfect milkshake, but&nbsp;even when applying that information sales didn’t improve. They realized they were not&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;the real purpose people have when buying a&nbsp;milkshake. After further investigation they realized most of&nbsp;the people buying milkshakes bought them first thing in&nbsp;the morning, and&nbsp;after more questioning they learned that many people were buying milkshakes as&nbsp;an easy on&nbsp;the go&nbsp;snack for&nbsp;their morning commute to&nbsp;work. This showed both the&nbsp;dangers of&nbsp;making demographic assumptions and&nbsp;not considering the&nbsp;job of&nbsp;your product when looking at&nbsp;the competitive&nbsp;landscape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s a&nbsp;great&nbsp;case.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>By the&nbsp;way, I&nbsp;am also taking GRC&nbsp;337, and&nbsp;in that class we&nbsp;are making personas as&nbsp;well. I&nbsp;hope the&nbsp;method to&nbsp;create personas for&nbsp;this class will&nbsp;similar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t think they’re very&nbsp;similar.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Our project doesn’t have too&nbsp;many similar products already on&nbsp;the market so&nbsp;there isn’t much to&nbsp;go off&nbsp;of design-wise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There’s always somewhere to&nbsp;take inspiration&nbsp;from.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In the&nbsp;first lecture intro video you&nbsp;spoke about how&nbsp;this class has&nbsp;been the&nbsp;one thats helped students land good jobs in&nbsp;the past. Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;recommendation on&nbsp;how we&nbsp;should include projects for&nbsp;UX research in&nbsp;our portfolios? I&nbsp;worked on&nbsp;another project like this in&nbsp;the past but&nbsp;have been unsure of&nbsp;the best way&nbsp;of displaying&nbsp;this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I do. And&nbsp;I’ll talk about it&nbsp;in the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;the quarter. If&nbsp;you need help now, you&nbsp;can always come to&nbsp;my office&nbsp;hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My old&nbsp;middle school teacher just retired and&nbsp;started her&nbsp;own company, and&nbsp;wants me&nbsp;to design the&nbsp;website, so&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;a super great opportunity if&nbsp;I’m able to&nbsp;do that. A&nbsp;year ago&nbsp;I&nbsp;definitely did&nbsp;not have enough experience to&nbsp;do something like this but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;could do&nbsp;it and&nbsp;have something valuable to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;my&nbsp;resume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s cool. But&nbsp;I suggest that you&nbsp;do it&nbsp;in&nbsp;Squarespace.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Overall good&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let’s keep it&nbsp;up!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p><strong>New links on&nbsp;the class&nbsp;website.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks to&nbsp;Olivia&nbsp;Chan.</p>
