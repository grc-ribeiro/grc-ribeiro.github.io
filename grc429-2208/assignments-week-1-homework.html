<h1>Audience justification  </h1>

<p>In this course, you will work for 10 weeks on the same project. In groups of one, two, or three students, you will create a new product that uses <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=augmented+reality">augmented reality</a> to help someone</strong> accomplish something <strong>more efficiently</strong> or <strong>more effectively</strong>.</p>

<p>Please start by watching the following videos:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQv74J7oSk">Microsoft HoloLens Demonstration</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHjjqKLFMXM">Microsoft HoloLens 2: Partner Spotlight with Bentley</a></p>

<p>Now, continue by watching more and more videos about augmented reality. Seriously, let yourself in this rabbit hole. </p>

<hr />

<h2>Task  </h2>

<p>Choose a specific product within these topics: </p>

<ol>
<li><h2>Cooking  </h2>

<p>A glass or goggle to help one cook. This person can be one cooking in their kitchen, a professional chef, or someone working in the kitchen of a fast&#8209;food restaurant. You may pick one of these examples or choose a similar one. <br />
<em>By the way: An&nbsp;app&nbsp;to&nbsp;find recipes for your leftovers is a terrible idea.</em></p></li>
<li><h2>Library  </h2>

<p>A glass or goggle to help librarians or patrons of a library. Or maybe it’s not a glass, but an augmented reality app on a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet. If you choose to work on the library theme, pick between librarians or patrons; it can’t be both. <br />
<em>By the way: An&nbsp;app&nbsp;to&nbsp;find books based on your reading history is a terrible idea.</em></p></li>
<li><h2>Navigation  </h2>

<p>It can be an augmented reality app on a car, bus, or truck windshield. It can be an augmented reality app on a helmet. It can also be a glass or goggles for those who are riding bikes, walking, or using public transportation. You may make it generic as a replacement for GPS apps or it can be more specific to navigate a museum or a national park, for example. <br />
<em>By the way: An&nbsp;app&nbsp;to&nbsp;find parking on campus is a terrible idea.</em></p></li>
<li><h2>Sports  </h2>

<p>This is the broadest of the categories. You can make it to someone who’s practicing, coaching, refereeing, or watching sports. It can be snowboard goggles; it can be for a behind-the-plate umpire in baseball; it can be for volleyball coaches; etc, etc, etc. <br />
<em>By the way: An&nbsp;app&nbsp;that will choose the music based on one’s running pace is&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible idea.</em></p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Tips  </h2>

<p>Be creative, but make sure to use <strong>augmented&nbsp;reality</strong> to enhance the experience. Don’t&nbsp;use choose a&nbsp;random project and try to make it fit augmented reality. Start with augmented reality and see what it can help with. And there’s nothing wrong to choose exactly one of my examples from the list above.  </p>

<hr />

<h2>Requirements  </h2>

<p>For this first week, <strong>each group</strong> needs to choose a first and a second choice from the list above. Then write <strong>two paragraphs for each choice</strong> answering the following&nbsp;questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did you choose this topic?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan to have access to potential users? </p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Submission  </h2>

<p>Submit your ideas on <strong>Canvas</strong> (as plain text) by <strong>Thursday, 17&nbsp;September&nbsp;2020, at&nbsp;11:59pm</strong>.</p>
