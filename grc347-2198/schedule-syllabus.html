<h1>Course expectations  </h1>

<h2>Attendance  </h2>

<p>You are&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;be in&nbsp;class ready to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the scheduled time. Class&nbsp;starts at&nbsp;11:10. Arriving late and/or leaving early will count as&nbsp;?&nbsp;absence. </p>

<p>Labs also contain lecture material, and&nbsp;you are&nbsp;accountable for&nbsp;the material presented in&nbsp;labs. Don&rsquo;t leave early unless you&nbsp;have made arrangements with me&nbsp;to do&nbsp;so. Arriving late and/or leaving early will count as&nbsp;?&nbsp;absence. There will be&nbsp;questions on&nbsp;the midterm and&nbsp;final exams that can&nbsp;only be&nbsp;answered from information presented in&nbsp;labs.</p>

<p>After two&nbsp;absences in lecture or lab, each&nbsp;?&nbsp;absence will result in&nbsp;less 1% of&nbsp;the final grade. If&nbsp;you are&nbsp;sick and&nbsp;can&rsquo;t attend our&nbsp;class meeting, however, please stay&nbsp;home. </p>

<p>If you&nbsp;miss a&nbsp;lecture or&nbsp;lab, you&nbsp;are fully responsible for&nbsp;getting that information. Exams cannot be&nbsp;taken early or&nbsp;late, only at&nbsp;the allowed time unless you&nbsp;provide documentation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;disability during the&nbsp;first two&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;class. </p>

<p>In the&nbsp;case of&nbsp;extenuating circumstances, such as&nbsp;an ongoing illness or&nbsp;the death of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loved&nbsp;one, the&nbsp;professor should be&nbsp;consulted as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible, and&nbsp;documentation from a&nbsp;doctor may&nbsp;be required. In&nbsp;such circumstances the&nbsp;faculty and&nbsp;student can&nbsp;negotiate the&nbsp;possibility of&nbsp;granting an&nbsp;&ldquo;Incomplete.&rdquo; In&nbsp;the rare cases where a&nbsp;student is&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;take an&nbsp;&ldquo;Incomplete&rdquo; as&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;extenuating circumstances, the&nbsp;student must follow the&nbsp;guidelines and&nbsp;timelines stipulated in&nbsp;the University&nbsp;catalog.</p>

<h2>Lab protocol  </h2>

<p>During the lab hours, you must work on the assignment for the week. If you finish your assignment earlier, you are encouraged to help other students. In the field of design it is important that you are able to share and discuss yours and others&rsquo; ideas. You may discuss solutions with a colleague, as long as each one of you is working on a different solution for the assignment. Helping others will make you grow as a designer, I&nbsp;promise.</p>

<p>If music makes you more productive, you are encouraged to bring some headphones for&nbsp;the&nbsp;labs. <strong>Do not play music through speakers.</strong> Also, do not play loud music on&nbsp;your headphones; it bothers other students and will prevent you from hearing the&nbsp;instructor.</p>

<h2>Plagiarism and originality  </h2>

<p>Please make sure the work you do for this courseis original in nature and not a revised version of something you were working on in another course. Dishonesty, cheating, deception, or plagiarism is not acceptable. Unless otherwise stated and&nbsp;referenced in &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; copyright guidelines, it is expected that all design work be original work of the student. Ifyou have any questions about academic integrity in relation to your work in this course, make sure to discuss them with me and/ or consult the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR). <strong>Plagiarism and cheating may result in expulsion from Cal&nbsp;Poly and every university in the CSU system</strong>.</p>

<h2>Email communication  </h2>

<p>Please note that I only respond to emails that are professionally written, with correct spelling, addressed properly. Though we are a pretty casual group in this department, please don&rsquo;t address your professors by last name only as this is rude. I would prefer that you call me by my name, which is Bruno. Or, if you prefer the more formal approach, please call me Mr.&nbsp;Ribeiro or Professor Ribeiro, but, again, mind the spelling. </p>

<p>I will make every effort to respond to your email with 24 hours during the week, but I don&rsquo;t usually respond to emails on weekends. Also, I don&rsquo;t do critique, review, lecture, or any other content exchange through email. Email communication must be short and address policies, requirements, deadlines, or other logistic related issues. </p>

<h2>Office hours  </h2>

<p>My office hours are listed on the top of this document. I encourage you to use them if you need more instruction beyond the lectures and labs. You should however be prepared with specific questions. Explain what efforts you have made to investigate the topic. Bring your notes from lectures and other material to help me understand what your needs are.  </p>

<h1>Evaluation  </h1>

<p>The assignments will be evaluated on their technical execution, quality of the visual language, and effectiveness of the solution. A&nbsp;100&#8209;point scale will be applied to&nbsp;all&nbsp;assignments, with different weights, as indicated on&nbsp;PolyLearn. A&nbsp;20&#8209;point penalty will be automatically applied to late work. Another 20&#8209;point penalty will be applied every 24&nbsp;hours after&nbsp;the&nbsp;original due time.</p>

<p><a href="class:grades"><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work is fully developed and refined. Solution is effective for the problem proposed.</a></p>

<p><a href="class:grades"><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work is well developed and the solution, although partially effective, could use more refinement.</a></p>

<p><a href="class:grades"><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work is complete, but the solution is not fully adequate and/or effective for&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;proposed.</a></p>

<p><a href="class:grades"><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment is incomplete and/or the solution is inadequate and ineffective for&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;proposed.</a></p>
