<h1>Packaging design  </h1>

<p>This project consists in designing packaging for a fictitious line of product in one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>car products  </li>
<li>cleaning supplies  </li>
<li>oral care  </li>
<li>eye care  </li>
<li>innerwear  </li>
<li>hardware</li>
</ol>

<p>Your category will be assigned randomly in class. </p>

<h2>Competitive analysis
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, you need to work on a preliminary analysis of the competitive landscape. You want to search for the main brands in your field as well as the not&#8209;so&#8209;known brands, with different, nicer visual language.</p>

<p>Use Pinterest or similar service to <em>collect</em> the images. </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Although, Pinterest is great for <em>collecting</em> images, it is <em>awful</em> tool for searching for images. Do not use Pinterest to look for your images. Find better sources and upload them to Pinterest yourself.</p>

<p>Include somewhere from 30 to 80 images on your board. (There&rsquo;s no penalty for doing more, though.)</p>

<p>The competitive analysis count for 5% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit the <strong>link</strong> to your image board until <strong>Monday,&nbsp;30&nbsp;September&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:10&nbsp;am</strong>.</p>
