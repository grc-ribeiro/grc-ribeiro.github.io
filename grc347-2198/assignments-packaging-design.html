<h1>Packaging design  </h1>

<p>This project consists in designing packaging for a fictitious line of product in one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>car products  </li>
<li>cleaning supplies  </li>
<li>oral care  </li>
<li>eye care  </li>
<li>innerwear  </li>
<li>hardware</li>
</ol>

<p>Your category will be assigned randomly in class. </p>

<hr id="Competitive-analysis" />

<h2>Competitive analysis
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, you need to work on a preliminary analysis of the competitive landscape. You want to search for the main brands in your field as well as the not&#8209;so&#8209;known brands, with different, nicer visual language.</p>

<p>Use Pinterest or similar service to <em>collect</em> the images. </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Although, Pinterest is great for <em>collecting</em> images, it is <em>awful</em> tool for searching for images. Do not use Pinterest to look for your images. Find better sources and upload them to Pinterest yourself.</p>

<p>Include somewhere from 30 to 80 images on your board. (There&rsquo;s no penalty for doing more, though.)</p>

<p>The competitive analysis count for 5% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit the <strong>link</strong> to your image board until <strong>Monday,&nbsp;30&nbsp;September&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:10&nbsp;am</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Brand-comparison-and-visual-references" />

<h2>Brand comparison and visual references
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, you will look for visual references to compare with your brand. Look for brands in other industries that &ldquo;speak&rdquo; the visual language that you want to apply to your brand. </p>

<p>You may also look for non&#8209;branded images with the appropriate look&#8209;and&#8209;feel of your brand.</p>

<p>Use Pinterest or similar service to <em>collect</em> the images. </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Although, Pinterest is great for <em>collecting</em> images, it is <em>awful</em> tool for searching for images. Do not use Pinterest to look for your images. Find better sources and upload them to Pinterest yourself.</p>

<p>Include somewhere from 30 to 80 images on your board. (Again, no penalty for doing more.)</p>

<p>The brand comparison and visual references count for 5% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit the <strong>link</strong> to your image board until <strong>Monday,&nbsp;7&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:10&nbsp;am</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Creative-brief" />

<h2>Creative brief
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, you need to write a <strong>creative brief</strong> for your project. Include points such as: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name of the product  </li>
<li>Products in the line of products  </li>
<li>Product/brand essence and/or voice  </li>
<li>Package design objectives  </li>
<li>Target audience identification and demographics  </li>
<li>Product attributes and distinguishing characteristics  </li>
<li>Competitive overview of rival brands and advantages</li>
</ul>

<p>The creative brief counts for 15% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a <strong>PDF</strong> until <strong>Monday,&nbsp;14&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:10&nbsp;am</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Visual-ideations" />

<h2>Visual ideations
  </h2>

<p>Based on your research and visual references develop at least three digital options for <strong>one product</strong>  of your line of products. (Still no penalty for doing more!) You want your ideas to be as different as possible. Explore different concepts, rather than different executions for the same concept. You don&rsquo;t need to be constrained by physical attributes, yet. Think of a label, the front of a box, a view of a round tin, etc. The goal is to develop a visual identity rather than being too concerned with the specifics of applying to the package. </p>

<p>Visual ideations count for 10% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a multi&#8209;page <strong>PDF</strong> before your lab on <strong>Tuesday,&nbsp;22&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019</strong> or  <strong>Thursday,&nbsp;24&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Material-research-and-spacial-explorations" />

<h2>Material research and spacial explorations
  </h2>

<p>Based on your research of materials, explain what material and processes you plan on using in your line of products. Explain the your decisions and make sure to include considerations on costs and environmental impact.</p>

<p>Include rough illustrations (sketches or digital) for possibilities on what the packaging will look like. </p>

<p>Material research and spacial explorations count for 10% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a multi&#8209;page <strong>PDF</strong> before your lab on <strong>Tuesday,&nbsp;29&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019</strong> or  <strong>Thursday,&nbsp;31&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Packaging-development" />

<h2>Packaging development
  </h2>

<p>Watch the <a href="resources.html">tutorials</a> and, based on the previous two assignments, explore some possibilities for your packages.</p>

<p>The goal at this point is not to have a polished complete assignment, but to explore the software and your solution applied to a 3d model.</p>

<p>No deliverables. Have fun!</p>

<hr id="first-draft" />

<h2>Line extension (first draft)
  </h2>

<p>Extend your packaging to the other products in your product line. You may have a total of three to five products in your line.</p>

<p>You want to consider how to keep consistency throughout the line of products still making them distinguishable internally and agains the competition.</p>

<p>The first draft for the line extension counts for 5% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p>You can make them flat or three&#8209;dimensional, whatever makes more sense to your line of product.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a multi&#8209;page <strong>PDF</strong> until your lab time on <strong>Tuesday,&nbsp;12&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019</strong> or <strong>Thursday,&nbsp;12&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019</strong>.</p>
