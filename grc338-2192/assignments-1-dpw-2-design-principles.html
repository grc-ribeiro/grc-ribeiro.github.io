<h1>Design principles examples  </h1>

<p>Read about the principles of design from the <em>Universal principles of design</em> book. </p>

<p>Find <strong>at least two images</strong> that will represent the principle <strong>assigned to you</strong> (find your name below). </p>

<p>One image should be of a physical product and the other should show a user interface. </p>

<p>Write <strong>one paragraph for each image</strong>, explaining why it is a <strong>good example</strong> of the principle. Use the theory of the book as well as your own words. </p>

<p>Each image should be <strong>1200px wide, at least</strong>. </p>

<p>Your images must be <strong>PNG files</strong>. If you downloaded them in any other format, open them in Photoshop (or another program) and save them as <code>.png</code>. If you just change the extension rather than resaving or exporting the files, it won’t be a true PNG file, and a penalty will be applied to your grade.</p>

<p>Read these tips on how to <a href="resources-how-to-take-good-screenshots-of-webpages-on-a-mac.html">take a good screenshot on a Mac</a>. </p>

<p>Submit two <strong>PNG files</strong> to PolyLearn: </p>

<p><strong><em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-1.png</em></strong> (Physical example) <br />
<strong><em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-2.png</em></strong> (Web design example)  </p>

<p>Use all lowercase and replace the spaces on the name with hyphens (<code>-</code>), <em>not underscores</em>.</p>

<p>(If you want to submit more than one image, just add lowercase letters after the numbers: <em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-1a.png</em>, <em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-1b.png</em>, etc., but keep the physical examples as #1 and web design examples as #2.)</p>

<p>No example designed by Apple or Google allowed.</p>

<p>Submit your <strong>paragraph descriptions as online text</strong> on PolyLearn.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="resources-design-principle-examples.html">two examples of submissions</a>, so you can have a better idea on how to write your paragraphs and how to name your image files.</p>

<p>You will present your images in class. It’s a very informal presentation, from your own seat, but you are expected to explain the principle assigned to you, using the images as examples.</p>

<h3>Always due on the Sunday before your presentation at 11:55pm.</h3>

<h4>You are strongly encouraged to <strong>meet with me during the week prior your deadline</strong> to discuss your examples before submitting your assignment. You may discuss your examples during office hours or&nbsp;during the lab.</h4>
