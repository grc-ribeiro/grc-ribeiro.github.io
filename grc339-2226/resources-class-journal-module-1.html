<h1>Class journal, week 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;working on&nbsp;getting used to&nbsp;the work schedule for&nbsp;this class. I&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;routine yet, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am working on&nbsp;developing&nbsp;one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">OK. But hurry up. 20% of the course is already behind us.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week, I&nbsp;slipped up&nbsp;on some of&nbsp;the due&nbsp;dates which was&nbsp;a frustrating start to&nbsp;summer classes, but&nbsp;you live and&nbsp;learn. Like 338, I&nbsp;will need to&nbsp;write down my&nbsp;due dates and&nbsp;set reminders, so&nbsp;this doesn’t happen&nbsp;again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good plan.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I realized I&nbsp;remember a&nbsp;fairly decent amount from 338. I&nbsp;realized I&nbsp;didn’t remember much from GitHub at&nbsp;first (had to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;how to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;again).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Can’t win them all. And there’s nothing wrong with looking up.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It is&nbsp;better to&nbsp;work offline when working on&nbsp;HTML/CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes! Always! Never forget that. Work on your files offline, then upload them to GitHub.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m glad to&nbsp;be taking this course right after 338&nbsp;so the&nbsp;content is&nbsp;still fresh in&nbsp;my mind but&nbsp;it is&nbsp;sad not&nbsp;to be&nbsp;taking this class in&nbsp;person. Working with others in&nbsp;lab is&nbsp;so helpful and&nbsp;fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I agree. Again, you may all want to come up with some virtual collaboration. Not as fun as in person, but it may work.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This class is&nbsp;fast so&nbsp;if anyone needs help or&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;work together on&nbsp;assignments feel free to&nbsp;reach&nbsp;out!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I think it’s a great idea, Tre! That’s why I have the <strong>Virtual collaboration</strong> discussion on Canvas. But nobody uses it. :sad face:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/</a> Is&nbsp;a good guide to&nbsp;flex box&nbsp;and visually demonstrates both the&nbsp;code and&nbsp;CSS application of&nbsp;each flex&nbsp;component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Both Sage and Sydney shared the same link. Thanks! I’ve added it to the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>flex-basis can&nbsp;function as&nbsp;the minimum&nbsp;width.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If you set your <code>flex-shrink</code> to <code>0</code>, it does.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The flex-shrink property can&nbsp;get complicated very&nbsp;fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">At least for me it can.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Can flexbox and&nbsp;CSS grid be&nbsp;used interchangeably or&nbsp;should they be&nbsp;used for&nbsp;different&nbsp;things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good question, and the answer is yes. Many times, they can be used interchangeably. However, there are some things that are easier to achieve with one or another. A (rather vague) rule of thumb is that you want to use grid when you want to have control of the layout and flexbox when you want the content to control the layout, giving it more flexibility. It’s okay to be confused by this statement for now, though. Eventually it may click. You will be able to decide for yourself once you have more control of both.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It would be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;use flexbox when you&nbsp;want the&nbsp;content to&nbsp;shape the&nbsp;layout while using the&nbsp;grid when you&nbsp;want your layout to&nbsp;shape your&nbsp;content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Very well put.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>If you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;make changes to&nbsp;your code after you&nbsp;already uploaded your files to&nbsp;GitHub, you&nbsp;can click into the&nbsp;file you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;edit and&nbsp;press the&nbsp;trash can&nbsp;to the&nbsp;top right corner to&nbsp;delete the&nbsp;file. Then, you&nbsp;simply just upload your updated file to&nbsp;the assignment folder&nbsp;again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can also upload to replace or click on the file and edit it. But the trick on how to delete a file is the most important here. (I’m constantly asked about it.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Is there a&nbsp;tool to&nbsp;make sure that lines do&nbsp;not have more than X&nbsp;words (16 in&nbsp;this case)? Or&nbsp;is counting each line that looks long the&nbsp;only&nbsp;option?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You have to count lines for now. Later in your career, you won’t need to; you’ll know at&nbsp;a&nbsp;glance.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;be aware of&nbsp;the line length on&nbsp;your website. A&nbsp;good line length should be&nbsp;between 8&nbsp;and 16&nbsp;words. To&nbsp;ensure your line length is&nbsp;not too&nbsp;long, we&nbsp;can define a&nbsp;max-width for&nbsp;the div&nbsp;container.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can define a <code>max-width</code> for anything. For example: sometimes, I define my <code>p</code> with a <code>max-width</code> of <code>36em</code>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>While taking notes this week, I&nbsp;found it&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;screenshot certain examples so&nbsp;when I&nbsp;refer back to&nbsp;my notes, I&nbsp;can see&nbsp;the way&nbsp;certain properties visually impact the&nbsp;webpage. #Lifehack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good idea!</p>
