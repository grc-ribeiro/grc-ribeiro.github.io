<h1>Food, sitcom,&nbsp;movies, and cities  </h1>

<h2>Fast and&nbsp;comfort&nbsp;food  </h2>

<p>Several of&nbsp;you mentioned <strong>In&#8209;N&#8209;Out</strong>, which I&nbsp;like very much, but&nbsp;we’ve been a&nbsp;<strong>Five&nbsp;Guys</strong> family since we&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;the U.S. twelve years ago. The&nbsp;first time my&nbsp;wife and I&nbsp;had&nbsp;their burgers at&nbsp;Ohio&nbsp;State campus got&nbsp;us hooked forever. But&nbsp;In&#8209;N&#8209;Out and&nbsp;<strong>Habit</strong> are&nbsp;alright too. If&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;Habit, you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;order the&nbsp;Santa Barbara Char, with avocado on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sourdough. </p>

<p>Several people mentioned <strong>McDonald’s</strong>, which was kind of a surprise. It’s not&nbsp;my first choice, but&nbsp;an easy solution on&nbsp;the road. My&nbsp;wife sometimes prefers it&nbsp;to In&#8209;N&#8209;Out, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t. <strong>Jack-In-The-Box</strong> was also mentioned, but I’ve only had it once a long time ago, so I can’t say much about it.</p>

<p>Two people mentioned <strong>Blaze Pizza</strong>. I like their pizza ok, but it takes forever. It was supposed to be fast. Somebody voted for <strong>Domino’s</strong>, which I haven’t had in forever. </p>

<p>Somebody mentioned that the fish and chips at Hoogies are “amazingggg”. I’ve never tried them, but I do like some fish and chips. </p>

<p>One person mentioned the <strong>Whole Foods Food Court</strong>. I think it’s practical, and they do offer some decent choices. But it’s not my kind of comfort food.</p>

<p>One person mentioned a Mediterranean place in their hometown called <strong>Flame &amp; Skewers</strong>. I love Mediterranean food, so if I’m ever in Bakersfield again, I’ll try it. Meanwhile, I find <strong>Petra</strong> here in SLO quite good. Also, one person mentioned <strong>Cava</strong>, but I’ve never tried it.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Pickles</strong> is nice, but I haven’t been there in a while. We had it in one of our faculty meetings a few years ago.</p>

<p>Another hometown vote was for <strong>Mas Tacos</strong>. Google points to Sacramento. I prefere my Mexican food from closer to the border, but I’m happy with any Mexican food. Actually, I take it back. Somebody wrote that “<strong>Taco Bell</strong> is a pretty solid fast food option”. I&nbsp;like this person, but they are very wrong. One person said “<strong>Taco Roco in SLO</strong> or <strong>Tacos de Mexico</strong> in Morro Bay”, but I haven’t had either.</p>

<p>Somebody mentioned <strong>Golden Deli</strong>, but I don’t know where that is.</p>

<p>Somebody mentioned <strong>Papa’s Thai</strong> and there was a vote for “any <strong>Thai</strong> restaurant”. This person can’t complain about choices in San Luis Obispo. </p>

<p>Another generic vote was for “anywhere that had boba and popcorn chicken”. Not my thing. Nor is <strong>Chick-fil-A</strong> or <strong>Canes</strong>.</p>

<p>There was one person who went with a classic: “fav comfort food is grilled cheese + tomato soup!” Not a bad choice.</p>

<p>And finally, somebody mentioned the Chevron gas station on Santa Rosa. I’m not kidding.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Sitcoms  </h2>

<p>Some of&nbsp;you mentioned <strong><em>Schitt’s Creek</em></strong>. My&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I highly recommend it&nbsp;too! </p>

<p>A lot of&nbsp;you mentioned <strong><em>New Girl</em></strong>, which I&nbsp;haven’t seen. I’ll put&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Netflix&nbsp;list.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Office</em></strong> is&nbsp;a classic and&nbsp;we love&nbsp;it. </p>

<p><strong><em>Friends</em></strong> is&nbsp;another classic. I&nbsp;saw it&nbsp;all several times back in&nbsp;the day. I&nbsp;don’t think it&nbsp;holds that well&nbsp;today.</p>

<p>I was never a big fan of <strong><em>Seinfeld</em></strong>. Many of my friends are. I never loved it.</p>

<p><strong><em>How I&nbsp;Met Your Mother</em></strong> is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>, and&nbsp;I saw&nbsp;it until season 7&nbsp;or 8&nbsp;when Barney licks a&nbsp;dog in&nbsp;the bar. I&nbsp;believe that episode is&nbsp;well regarded as&nbsp;the “jumping-shark” moment of&nbsp;the&nbsp;series.</p>

<p>I gave up on <strong><em>Shameless</em></strong> after six or seven seasons. No show should go longer than six seasons, by the way.</p>

<p>I’ve seen some episodes of <strong><em>Parks and Rec</em></strong> on airplanes. It was fine for airplanes, but I didn’t love it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bojack Horseman</em></strong> has been recommended. But I don’t think it’s for me.</p>

<p>I’ve never heard of <strong><em>The Mick</em></strong>, <strong><em>Crashing</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Psych</em></strong> before. I’ll check them out.</p>

<p>I’ve never seen  <strong><em>Arrested development</em></strong>, <strong><em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em></strong>, <strong><em>It's Always Sunny in&nbsp;Philadelphia</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Full House</em></strong> either.</p>

<p>And several of&nbsp;you couldn’t recommend anything because you&nbsp;don’t watch sitcoms at&nbsp;all. Which found a&nbsp;little surprising, but&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;fine.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Movies  </h2>

<p>Several of you mentioned the new <strong><em>Top Gun</em></strong>. I’ll see it on a flight eventually.</p>

<p>The new <strong><em>Elvis</em></strong> movie was also mentioned. That I may see with my wife at home.</p>

<p>Somebody mentioned <strong><em>Little Miss Sunshine</em></strong>. I love it. I saw it in the theaters.</p>

<p>Somebody mentioned <strong><em>Coco</em></strong>. I think it’s great, but I asked for no animation because I’ve seen them all. And somebody mentioned <strong><em>Marcel the Shell with Shoes On</em></strong>. (“It’s not animation; it’s stop motion”, they said. Well, I haven’t seen it, so I guess they’re right.)</p>

<p>Somebody wrote that <strong><em>The Social Network</em></strong> is a great movie. It isn’t.</p>

<p>Also mentioned: <strong><em>Girl in the Picture</em></strong>, <strong><em>Money Heist: Korea</em></strong>, <strong><em>Last Night in Soho</em></strong>, <strong><em>We're the Millers</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dunkirk</em></strong>, <strong><em>Molly's Game</em></strong>, <strong><em>Into the Wild</em></strong>, <strong><em>Vivarium</em></strong>, <strong><em>Knives Out</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jurassic World Dominion</em></strong>, <strong><em>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</em></strong>, <strong><em>Midsommar</em></strong>, <strong><em>BlacKkKlansman</em></strong>, <strong><em>Baby Driver</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Darjeeling Limited</em></strong>, <strong><em>Spiderman: No Way Home</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Call Me by Your Name</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen many movies recently, but I’ll recommend <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9620292/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Promising&nbsp;young&nbsp;woman</em></strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Palm&nbsp;Springs</em></strong></a> that I&nbsp;saw last year.</p>

<h2>Cities  </h2>

<p>Somebody said that they have been in <strong>Edinburgh, Scotland</strong> years ago and would like to go back. I was there not years, but decades ago (1995). Would love to go back. It’s fantastic!</p>

<p>My wife and I love <strong>New York City</strong>! We took our kids there in the summer of 2019. They were 4 and 6, and absolutely loved it! My dad and my sister love it too. </p>

<p><strong>Florence, Italy</strong> is beautiful! But <strong>Paris</strong> is more!</p>

<p><strong>Nice</strong> is a charming city in South France.</p>

<p>I need to go back to <strong>Amsterdam</strong> to give it a second chance. I was there in my mid&#8209;twenties (2003), but I didn’t love it.</p>

<p>I’ve never been to <strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>, but I was in <strong>Wellington</strong> (which was also mentioned) for a conference in 2019 and it was super fun. Super cool city.</p>

<p><strong>Barcelona</strong> is very touristic, but its architecture and bars are well worth it.</p>

<p>Several of you mentioned <strong>Tokyo</strong>, which I think that could be on top of my list too.</p>

<p>Other cities that were mentioned that I’ve never been to, but are in my list too are <strong>Chicago</strong>, <strong>New Orleans</strong>, <strong>Busan, Korea</strong>, <strong>Seoul, Korea</strong>, <strong>Split, Croatia</strong>, <strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>, <strong>Lake Como, Italy</strong>, <strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>, <strong>The Hague, Netherland</strong>, <strong>Okinawa, Japan</strong>, <strong>Kyoto, Japan</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Salem, Massachusetts</strong> is not.</p>
