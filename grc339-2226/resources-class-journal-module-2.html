  <p>When I&nbsp;checked my&nbsp;Flexbox Form on&nbsp;my phone, it&nbsp;had the&nbsp;same layout as&nbsp;the desktop version. When I&nbsp;make the&nbsp;browser window narrower on&nbsp;my PC, it&nbsp;is responsive so&nbsp;why is&nbsp;my phone not&nbsp;displaying the&nbsp;narrow layout? (I have tried Firefox, Chrome, and&nbsp;Safari).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Because I failed to include a line on the HTML. Aidan was the one who pointed that out to me in the email. Thanks for checking on mobile, though!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I had&nbsp;some trouble with using Chrome/Firefox to&nbsp;test the&nbsp;responsiveness of&nbsp;layout but&nbsp;adding <code>&lt;meta name="viewport” content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code> to&nbsp;the HTML file fixed&nbsp;that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for pointing that out, Aidan!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have learned that I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;adjust the&nbsp;flex in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;conform to&nbsp;narrow browser windows. I&nbsp;initially thought it&nbsp;was adjusting the&nbsp;div.container margin, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;realized that the&nbsp;flex basis was&nbsp;bigger than the&nbsp;auto margin size, so&nbsp;it could not&nbsp;adjust to&nbsp;smaller sizes&nbsp;properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That was a common mistake in the flexbox form assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;wondering if&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;submit one&nbsp;of these orders, where would the&nbsp;info&nbsp;go?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They wouldn’t go anywhere, because I didn’t set it up to work.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think it’s interesting to&nbsp;insert different numbers when trying to&nbsp;get sizing correct for&nbsp;objects on&nbsp;screen because it&nbsp;really allows you&nbsp;to see&nbsp;how the&nbsp;integers affect the&nbsp;ratios of&nbsp;the different objects. This was&nbsp;something I&nbsp;realized when attempting to&nbsp;change the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;columns for&nbsp;burger options on&nbsp;different size&nbsp;screens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s a good idea. Insert a few numbers to see the differences.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week I&nbsp;found myself making mistakes in&nbsp;my code when I&nbsp;was working later at&nbsp;night. I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;is better for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;work earlier in&nbsp;the day&nbsp;to make sure that I&nbsp;am typing in&nbsp;my code correctly because I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;mistakes that made the&nbsp;whole process take a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Work in the morning, not late at night.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bless Sydney. She&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;so much in&nbsp;this&nbsp;assignment. Also, bless Sage and Lauren for helping me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad to hear that you’re helping each other.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Want to&nbsp;thank Lyla for&nbsp;the help on&nbsp;the recent&nbsp;assignment!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Very nice!</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What’s the&nbsp;main difference between a&nbsp;carousel and&nbsp;the photo gallery? They feel somewhat the&nbsp;same but&nbsp;I&nbsp;know you&nbsp;dislike&nbsp;carousels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">What I refer as a carousel is the feature usually on the home page where to highlight several different stories, you have them all rotating (usually automatically) in one space. It’s not effective, because nobody watches them. Until 2013&#8209;ish, everybody was concerned with <a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/is-it-a-myth-heres-why-we-still-use-above-the-fold-in-landing-pages-e67ddfd1895d" target="_blank">“above the fold”</a>, assuming (wrongly!) that users didn’t scroll. Look at the <a href="http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/" target="_blank">GrC’s home page</a>, for example. Several stories in the carousel, but only the first one is really highlighted, since most users will just scroll down looking for what they want. Galleries are very different. They are a collection of images, and you are there to calmly look at one of them at your own pace. Don’t make them links to stories and don’t use automatic change, but do include thumbnails for the navigation.</p>

  <p>Can we&nbsp;combine grids and&nbsp;flow boxes? Yes&nbsp;we can! Link to&nbsp;a good resource on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;combine these two&nbsp;skills we&nbsp;learned: <a href="https://getflywheel.com/layout/combine-flexbox-and-css-grids-for-layouts-how-to/" target="_blank">https://getflywheel.com/layout/combine-flexbox-and-css-grids-for-layouts-how-to/</a>.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Tre!</p>

  <p><a href="https://learncssgrid.com/" target="_blank">Learn CSS&nbsp;Grid</a> is&nbsp;a good resource to&nbsp;refresh your memory on&nbsp;the CSS&nbsp;Grid. It&nbsp;provides information on&nbsp;the different CSS&nbsp;Grid properties along with a&nbsp;visual representation of&nbsp;what each property&nbsp;does.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Mandy!</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I read somewhere that grids are&nbsp;typically used in&nbsp;two-dimensional grid-based layouts where both columns and&nbsp;rows are&nbsp;used, while flexbox is&nbsp;typically used for&nbsp;one-dimensional grids, so&nbsp;only using rows or&nbsp;columns. Is&nbsp;this&nbsp;true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s one way to use them. But I chose grid for the one-dimensional navigation on the photo gallery assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p><code>left: 100%</code> moves everything to&nbsp;the&nbsp;right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct. It adds space to the left.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Line 62&nbsp;still confuses me&nbsp;a little&nbsp;bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I believe you’re talking about the photo gallery assignment. In line 62, all you need is to <strong>repeat</strong> the same value <strong>4</strong> times, and you don’t need to know what that value is. You know it’s a <strong>fraction</strong> of the grid, though. So, it’s <code>repeat(4, 1fr)</code>.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;really excited to&nbsp;start on&nbsp;the digital magazine. All&nbsp;of the&nbsp;lessons leading up&nbsp;to the&nbsp;project are&nbsp;getting me&nbsp;excited…. but&nbsp;I&nbsp;still haven’t settled on&nbsp;a&nbsp;theme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I look forward to seeing everybody’s magazine too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I miss hearing about everyone’s cool projects and&nbsp;progress in&nbsp;GrC. What are&nbsp;some things you&nbsp;are curious about during this summer? What are&nbsp;some things you&nbsp;are working&nbsp;on?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m opening the question to everybody. But I’m finishing a video for a research paper I wrote with Colleen for TAGA. And then, I’ll be working on the material for the motion graphic class I’ll be teaching next spring.</p>
