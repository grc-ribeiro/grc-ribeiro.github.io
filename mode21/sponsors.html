<h2>Sponsors</h2>

<p>We invite you to be a sponsor for <span class="allcaps">Mode</span> 2021. Founded in 2013, we encourage, share, and help shape motion design by providing a platform for research and pedagogy to be explored and celebrated. As an independent group of academic collaborators, we do not have membership fees to help offset conference costs. In order to make the registration fees less burdensome on our attendees, and to make the conference experience as fulfilling and engaging as possible, we need help from industry leaders, like you.</p>

<p>Why become a sponsor? Connect directly with teaching experts from around the world. At <span class="allcaps">Mode</span>, you will have the chance to increase your company’s presence and take advantage of networking opportunities while demonstrating your commitment to advancing motion design education and the industry. Interact with faculty and influencers from academic institutions that work with a new group of students each year!  For more information about sponsorship opportunities please contact us!</p>
