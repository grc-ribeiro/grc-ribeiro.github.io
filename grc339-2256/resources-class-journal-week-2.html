<h1>Class journal, module 2 </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I am&nbsp;slowly learning that learning how&nbsp;to code online is&nbsp;difficult. I&nbsp;need things to&nbsp;be explained to&nbsp;me in-person so&nbsp;that I&nbsp;(or other students) can&nbsp;ask questions in&nbsp;real-time and&nbsp;collaborate with other students in&nbsp;the class. I&nbsp;don’t know how&nbsp;CS majors are&nbsp;able to&nbsp;learn coding online so&nbsp;quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">It is a little trickier. That’s why I have the in&#8209;person labs during the year. The summer, online version of the class is intended to those who are more comfortable with code and need to accelerate their education for some reason.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>This week’s assignments were a&nbsp;bit more challenging, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;made sure to&nbsp;follow along with the&nbsp;video tutorials to&nbsp;help!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s the idea!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I would be&nbsp;curious to&nbsp;gain access to&nbsp;actual website’s HTML/CSS, to&nbsp;compare and&nbsp;contrast. I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;some of&nbsp;their design&nbsp;habits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">On every browser, you can look the source code of every page. That was extremely helpful when websites were more static. Nowadays, the code is way more complex when you peek at them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Some list items in&nbsp;my form didn’t look exactly like the&nbsp;example given. I’m assuming most of&nbsp;that is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;your browser (e.g. Firefox vs. Safari)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes. Rendering in different browsers (or different versions of browsers) are not exactly the same. And that’s something we always need to keep in mind. Test in different browsers, devices, and window sizes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I realized that absolutely positioned elements don’t contribute to&nbsp;their parent’s height, which explained why&nbsp;the main element collapsed without extra padding or&nbsp;min&nbsp;height.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Exactly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Is the&nbsp;functionality and&nbsp;animation of&nbsp;the CSS&nbsp;gallery something that can&nbsp;be done in&nbsp;JavaScript? If&nbsp;so, which is&nbsp;preferred in&nbsp;the&nbsp;industry?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">The gallery can be done in JavaScript, and that’s probably what most people would do in the industry. The non-JS version that you learned can be more accessible, secure, and faster, though. In the industry, you may end up working where they rely heavily on JavaScript or maybe you will work at a place where they despise it. That’s why it’s good to have some experience with JavaScript (GRC&nbsp;340) and experience with replacing it with pure HTML/CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Used Flexbox on&nbsp;grouped form sections (<code>.order ul, .method ul</code>) so&nbsp;options align neatly in&nbsp;rows and&nbsp;wrap when&nbsp;needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s a nice trick to keep it consistent.</p>

<p class="disclaimer">We all make mistakes, and I&nbsp;appreciate if&nbsp;you&nbsp;let&nbsp;me know when you&nbsp;catch any&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;several mistakes I’ll&nbsp;make this quarter. Students who&nbsp;find insconsistent dates or&nbsp;instructions on&nbsp;any&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;assignments will&nbsp;be&nbsp;rewarded with&nbsp;candy.</p>
