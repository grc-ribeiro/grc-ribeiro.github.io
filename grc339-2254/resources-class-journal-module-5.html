<h1>Class journal, module 5  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bruno made coffee when there wasn’t any&nbsp;in the&nbsp;GRC office…not all&nbsp;heroes wear&nbsp;capes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You got that right!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I just finally noticed that in&nbsp;your tutorial videos you&nbsp;use a&nbsp;song from the&nbsp;Ramones. Great music choice as&nbsp;always, Bruno. I&nbsp;think The&nbsp;Clash might be&nbsp;better&nbsp;though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">😎🎸</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This lab&nbsp;was the&nbsp;most time-consuming one&nbsp;yet, but&nbsp;it was&nbsp;super satisfying once everything was&nbsp;done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">This seems to be the overall sentiment in the class, and I’m happy with it. The&nbsp;labs are supposed to be challenging, but not frustrating, and I&nbsp;believe we got there this week.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found it&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;go into office hours to&nbsp;get clarification and&nbsp;help when I&nbsp;was&nbsp;confused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">More students should come more often.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It would be&nbsp;super helpful if&nbsp;you could provide other videos that would show us&nbsp;the skills we&nbsp;needed if&nbsp;we wanted a&nbsp;little more in&nbsp;depth&nbsp;explanation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t believe you <em>needed</em> more knowledge than the short videos I&nbsp;make. If, however, you <em>want</em> to go deeper, I&nbsp;do encourage you to research more. But it is the students’ responsibility to push their education further according to their interests. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I don’t think I&nbsp;did the&nbsp;lab completely right, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;use AI&nbsp;to find errors in&nbsp;my code which can&nbsp;be&nbsp;risky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Very risky. I&nbsp;don’t recommend.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This assignment was&nbsp;much harder than the&nbsp;last one&nbsp;where we&nbsp;just got&nbsp;fill in&nbsp;the blanks, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fun&nbsp;challenge!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Challenging is more fun, right? Last week’s assignment was way too easy…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Asking students around me&nbsp;for help is&nbsp;helpful, even just knowing that we’re all&nbsp;confused about something makes me&nbsp;feel&nbsp;better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That makes sense…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There’s more than one&nbsp;way to&nbsp;achieve the&nbsp;same result. Just because your neighbor’s code looks a&nbsp;little different doesn’t necessarily mean one&nbsp;of you&nbsp;is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s correct. Conversely, if you both have the same code, it doesn’t mean it’s correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s always a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;trade contact info with a&nbsp;classmate, this way&nbsp;you can&nbsp;help each other outside of&nbsp;class!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes! One hundred percent.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Listening to&nbsp;music is&nbsp;actually really helpful, especially in&nbsp;this assignment where there’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;repeating elements but&nbsp;with different&nbsp;names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I can’t work without music.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;for answering all&nbsp;of my&nbsp;questions even the&nbsp;silly&nbsp;ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">A&nbsp;student once wrote in&nbsp;the journal that, in&nbsp;GRC&nbsp;339, I&nbsp;would answer questions that I&nbsp;wouldn’t answer in&nbsp;GRC&nbsp;338. Maybe they had a point.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Today was&nbsp;a stress lab, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;was really&nbsp;productive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad you felt productive. It was supposed to be challenging, difficult even, but you’re not supposed to <em>stress</em>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I enjoy having a&nbsp;challenge. However, I&nbsp;like being walked through how&nbsp;to do&nbsp;something more than just having to&nbsp;figure it&nbsp;out&nbsp;myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Being walked through is not really a challenge. And you did have all the tools to make them work. The challenge lies on figuring out rather than doing what you’re told.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Do we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;write all&nbsp;our own&nbsp;website&nbsp;content?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can ask ChatGPT.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Since I&nbsp;learned <code>⌘</code> + <code>/</code> on&nbsp;a line, it’s been a&nbsp;huge time&nbsp;saver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Works on both HTML and CSS, and in almost every text editor.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using an&nbsp;eyedropper tool helps get&nbsp;specific colors from the&nbsp;example&nbsp;website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You forgot about the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/digital-color-meter/welcome/mac" target="_blank">Digital Color Meter</a></p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using the&nbsp;inspect tool is&nbsp;very helpful for&nbsp;figuring out&nbsp;what part of&nbsp;your code is&nbsp;affecting&nbsp;what.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Going outside and&nbsp;taking a&nbsp;short walk during lab&nbsp;helped refresh my&nbsp;mind when I&nbsp;felt&nbsp;stuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It helps.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I felt like this lab&nbsp;was overwhelming at&nbsp;first but&nbsp;taking it&nbsp;into parts and&nbsp;tackling it&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s the only way to go.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m excited to&nbsp;start putting in&nbsp;my own&nbsp;images and&nbsp;text, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;find it&nbsp;great that I&nbsp;am creating the&nbsp;structure first. I&nbsp;think that will be&nbsp;very&nbsp;useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I promise you it will.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>If you&nbsp;updated parts of&nbsp;your code, save every HTML and&nbsp;CSS page before refreshing to&nbsp;check your&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Save and refresh at every small step.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Sometimes making a&nbsp;drastic change (like making your margin 10em) helps a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;easily see&nbsp;the impact of&nbsp;your&nbsp;edits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good tip.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s been helpful to&nbsp;sit next to&nbsp;people who&nbsp;are willing to&nbsp;help double check lines and&nbsp;whatnot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It always warms my heart.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;curious how&nbsp;difficult it&nbsp;gets to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;single CSS&nbsp;document once you&nbsp;have many separate&nbsp;pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It depends on how different they are. If the pages follow the same structure, then the CSS can be quite concise. If the pages are too different, you may need more classes and have a longer CSS. I wouldn’t say it gets more difficult, but it can get more complex.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I couldn’t figure out&nbsp;why my&nbsp;<code>aside h2</code> wasn’t changing, but&nbsp;Bruno helped me&nbsp;realize in&nbsp;my CSS&nbsp;I&nbsp;had another section that was&nbsp;referring to&nbsp;a section inside of&nbsp;the aside which was&nbsp;overriding&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, that was an interesting case. Because the previous declaration block was more specific, the latter declaration block would not override. CSS prioritize latter over former, but it also prioritizes more specific over less specific. And because the former declaration block’s selector made reference to a class, it was more specific. It took me a minute to figure that one out, but I&nbsp;wouldn’t say you made a <em>mistake</em>; with the knowledge that you had, you did everything right.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like how&nbsp;this week’s lab&nbsp;reinforced how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;CSS selectors to: target specific types of&nbsp;elements; style elements based on&nbsp;their class; style elements within specific parent&nbsp;containers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Exactly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Still confused on&nbsp;what the&nbsp;<code>@media only</code>&nbsp;does?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I got this question from a few students. Please go back to the GRC&nbsp;338 videos, then. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;last video, you can learn about media queries. There’s a reason why GRC&nbsp;338 is a prerequisite to GRC&nbsp;339 and why I&nbsp;put all the GRC&nbsp;338 up for review in the first week of classes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In your mobile design, the&nbsp;text has&nbsp;left and&nbsp;right margins, while images extend edge-to-edge. On&nbsp;wider screens, text and&nbsp;images are&nbsp;aligned to&nbsp;the same left and&nbsp;right lines. Do&nbsp;you achieve this by&nbsp;adding margins to&nbsp;the images, removing margins from the&nbsp;text, or&nbsp;another&nbsp;way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I added margins to the text, and then removed them in the media query. But you could also <em>add</em> margins to the <em>images</em> in the media query. (Although, this question should be asked in the lab or office hours, now it might be a little too late.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>If text is <code>font-size: 2em</code> and <code>margin: 1em</code>, then text with <code>font-size: 4em</code> requires just <code>.5em</code> margin to keep both text sizes equidistant from the containing element. </p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct. Or you can use <code>margin: 2rem</code> on either or both.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What is the difference between em and rem, and how do I know which one to use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">According to the excelent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units#relative_length_units" target="_blank">MDN</a>, “<code>em</code> is relative to the font size of this element, or the font size of the parent element when used for <code>font-size</code>. <code>rem</code> is relative to the font size of the root element”. So <code>rem</code> will not be affected by the font-size, while <code>em</code> is. It avoids doing math.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>We design mobile first because people use&nbsp;mobile more often and&nbsp;it’s better to&nbsp;start simpler in&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Exactly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Our GitHub link for&nbsp;double checking our&nbsp;lab code did&nbsp;not include “index.html” so&nbsp;the link did&nbsp;not work (at least for&nbsp;me).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It doesn’t need <code>index.html</code> in the end, and it does work. (Try again.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>To change the&nbsp;leading of&nbsp;text, use&nbsp;the <code>line-height</code> property in&nbsp;ems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good tip. The default is a little too tight in most browsers.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I ate&nbsp;my peanut butter cup, don’t&nbsp;worry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for the update.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bruno loves&nbsp;soccer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I do. But I love playing soccer more than watching it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For this kinda long labs we&nbsp;would need more candies, Bruno.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">’K…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Me too, Bruno, I&nbsp;sometimes stay up&nbsp;too late on&nbsp;my&nbsp;phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not the best decision, right? But I gotta say, it’s better than staying up late working.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that I&nbsp;can charge my&nbsp;laptop by&nbsp;plugging it&nbsp;into the&nbsp;macs which is&nbsp;a <strong>gamechanger</strong>. No&nbsp;more searching for&nbsp;outlets in&nbsp;the walls of&nbsp;the&nbsp;room!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Great tip!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;cool to&nbsp;see Bruno juggle in&nbsp;lab! Would love to&nbsp;see more of&nbsp;that during class&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">🤹</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really enjoyed this lab, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt really accomplished when I&nbsp;finished&nbsp;it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Glad to hear! On to the next challenge! (The next assignment opens as soon as you mark this journal highlight as read.)</p>

<hr />

<p  class="classjournal">👉 Alright! Mark this journal highlights page as read and check next module’s assignment. Let me know if it’s not open! You do want to work on it before the next lab.</p>
