<h1>Class journal, module 6  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I‚Äôm going to&nbsp;make such a&nbsp;good Pinterest board for&nbsp;inspiration. I&nbsp;love making&nbsp;boards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Think of them as visual references rather than <em>mood boards</em>, though. Make&nbsp;sure you include examples of <strong>websites</strong> with similar visual language, examples of <strong>design</strong> with similar color palette, and, of course, examples using <strong>typography</strong>. Those will be the examples you‚Äôll be <em>copying</em> from. If you copy from one source, that‚Äôs plagiarism; you need to copy from several places, make your own Frankestein monster, and then make it beautiful and cohesive.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The video tutorial was&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;follow and&nbsp;made the&nbsp;assignment easy to&nbsp;understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">A little too easy, though. To the point that some of you (who are really good at following instructions and paying attention to details) finished it without really understanding what you‚Äôre doing. That‚Äôs fine for now, but for the next step of the magazine in module 8, <a href="assignments-digital-magazine-visual-language.html">the visual language</a>, you‚Äôll need to have better understanding of the declaration blocks in CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bruno likes to&nbsp;hand out&nbsp;candy to&nbsp;students who&nbsp;answer&nbsp;questions!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. We‚Äôre done with quizzes this quarter. But next quarter, I‚Äôll have candy just for those who participate in class.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>If the&nbsp;VS Code colors aren‚Äôt looking the&nbsp;way you&nbsp;expect them to, you&nbsp;probably did&nbsp;something&nbsp;wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using HTML/CSS formatters more frequently while your actively working can&nbsp;help you&nbsp;find issues faster and&nbsp;just work more&nbsp;efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There are extensions you can install on your VS Code too. I‚Äôve&nbsp;never used them, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I get&nbsp;scared to&nbsp;delete my&nbsp;code as&nbsp;I‚Äôm editing it, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;always end&nbsp;up with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;comments in&nbsp;my CSS&nbsp;instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I hear you. I&nbsp;am scared of&nbsp;deleting anything, so&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;few <strong>style 2&nbsp;copy copy 2.css</strong> files in&nbsp;my&nbsp;computer.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When following along with Bruno‚Äôs videos, it&nbsp;is helpful to&nbsp;pause and&nbsp;check your website every time Bruno pauses and&nbsp;checks his&nbsp;website so&nbsp;that you&nbsp;can see&nbsp;if the&nbsp;code is&nbsp;working the&nbsp;same on&nbsp;your&nbsp;end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That‚Äôs the only way.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Shoutout Piper for&nbsp;finding the&nbsp;error in&nbsp;my code and&nbsp;re-teaching me&nbsp;how to&nbsp;use the&nbsp;web dev&nbsp;tool feature in&nbsp;Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks, Piper!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using coding forums helped a&nbsp;lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">All the information you needed are in the videos. Be careful when following instructions from anyone on the internet. Most of the time, it results in several penalties.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using W3Schools as&nbsp;a coding source to&nbsp;help breakdown different coding concepts has&nbsp;been super&nbsp;helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> are always very helpful. You can understand the real meaning and proper use of each element, for example.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>At one&nbsp;point when I&nbsp;was changing my&nbsp;CSS, one&nbsp;of the&nbsp;teasers on&nbsp;the main page wouldn‚Äôt fit&nbsp;into the&nbsp;second row&nbsp;of the&nbsp;gird, I&nbsp;was very frustrated by&nbsp;this as&nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn‚Äôt figure out&nbsp;what was&nbsp;wrong. I&nbsp;finally found that the&nbsp;issue was&nbsp;in my&nbsp;HTML when I&nbsp;didn‚Äôt close the&nbsp;most recent tag&nbsp;first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There were similar issues with other students.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Adding a&nbsp;second media query makes perfect sense, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;never would have thought to&nbsp;do it&nbsp;on my&nbsp;own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Have as many as you need.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;curious how&nbsp;large websites deal with so&nbsp;much CSS&nbsp;where one&nbsp;small change can&nbsp;affect many elements. Do&nbsp;they simply use&nbsp;many CSS&nbsp;files?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Usually they don‚Äôt. But there are a lot of classes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I see&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of websites use&nbsp;hamburger menus when they‚Äôre in&nbsp;mobile. Is&nbsp;that something that can&nbsp;be done in&nbsp;HTML/CSS? What would you&nbsp;advise regarding their&nbsp;use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It can be done with HTML and CSS. But I‚Äôm not a fan of hiding content behind it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My CSS&nbsp;final boss are&nbsp;margins and&nbsp;paddings. Sometimes it‚Äôs margins, but&nbsp;sometimes it‚Äôs padding. Sometimes it‚Äôs both? Sometimes neither. Whatever the&nbsp;case, the&nbsp;video this week helped remind me&nbsp;that background colors visualize the&nbsp;difference&nbsp;well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And sometimes it‚Äôs either.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Do you&nbsp;have any&nbsp;tips for&nbsp;the digital magazine when we&nbsp;create our&nbsp;own&nbsp;concept?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Do something a topic you have interest in and that you want to work with its aesthetics.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I hope next lab&nbsp;we have a&nbsp;step-by-step as&nbsp;well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Next lab is the proposal. And then you‚Äôll be working on your own magazine, so we&nbsp;can‚Äôt have step&#8209;by&#8209;step.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Looked through some of&nbsp;the older magazines. I&nbsp;liked Sai‚Äôs and&nbsp;Emily Vitanatchi‚Äôs. Good&nbsp;inspiration!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I&nbsp;encourage you all to take a look in at least a few of them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What are&nbsp;we submitting for&nbsp;the magazine&nbsp;proposal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can see it for yourself. (The assignment is open.) But it‚Äôs a proposal for your magazine‚Ä¶</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bruno is&nbsp;magical and&nbsp;can fix&nbsp;issues with just his&nbsp;presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I try to use this power for the good.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Sometimes, all&nbsp;it takes to&nbsp;fix a&nbsp;problem is&nbsp;for Bruno to&nbsp;glance at&nbsp;it. Something about his&nbsp;gaze is&nbsp;magical and&nbsp;unexplainable!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Magical, yes. But not unexplainable. It‚Äôs magic.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week‚Äôs lab&nbsp;song: ‚ÄúToo&nbsp;Many Pwr&nbsp;Chords‚Äù by&nbsp;MX&nbsp;LONELY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Cool song!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What is&nbsp;your favorite Ramones album? I&nbsp;like Rocket to&nbsp;Russia (basic choice).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The first Ramones album I ever listened was <em>Loco Live</em>, and that‚Äôs always been my favorite. As far as studio albums, I‚Äôll go with an unpopular choice, <em>Mondo Bizarro</em>. That was the first album they released after I had become a fan. My dad was in a trip to London, so I asked him to bring a copy for me because it would be a while until it was released in Brazil. For extra context, the year was 1992, and I&nbsp;was 14.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Fun fact: I‚Äôm at&nbsp;Config right&nbsp;now!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That is, indeed, fun! Please report back! (Also, check the class <a href="readings.html">readings</a> for an opinion on Figma Sites.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I‚Äôm starting to&nbsp;believe that Bruno doesn‚Äôt have candy&nbsp;anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It‚Äôs actually true. The candy comes from the office, and they ran out. Let‚Äôs hope the situation is fixed in the near future. ü§û</p>
