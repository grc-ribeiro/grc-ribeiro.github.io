<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>A lot&nbsp;of historic designers were women :D</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes! And each one of them was a brave pioneer in their own way!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Translating the&nbsp;font to&nbsp;6 pixels is&nbsp;tough :/ but&nbsp;fun! I&nbsp;am determined to&nbsp;have&nbsp;fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I failed in my attempting of not letting you have fun in the lab.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>No candy for&nbsp;3–6pm lab&nbsp;this week… <strong>and&nbsp;that’s okay</strong>!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">You all left early!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Being obsessed with design and&nbsp;researching famous designers and&nbsp;understanding their techniques, work, ideas, etc. is&nbsp;a great way&nbsp;to become a&nbsp;better designer and&nbsp;be exposed to&nbsp;new&nbsp;ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes. Every good designer is a design nerd.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I struggled with the&nbsp;6‑square font the&nbsp;most, which forced me&nbsp;to think of&nbsp;creative&nbsp;solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Exactly! Constrains force you to think of creative solution.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Collaboration was&nbsp;very helpful towards navigating the&nbsp;best placement of&nbsp;pixels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I’m glad to hear!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>It’s helpful to&nbsp;ask your peers for&nbsp;help. They can&nbsp;sometimes see&nbsp;things that you&nbsp;can’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Absolutely. First, we all see things differently. And second, we all get some fatigue from look at our own work for too long.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Learned about the&nbsp;term “pressure” from the&nbsp;reading. Hadn’t heard this concept as&nbsp;that name before, but&nbsp;it highlights some really important elements in&nbsp;typesetting and&nbsp;how the&nbsp;“pressure” can&nbsp;change based on&nbsp;their&nbsp;relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">I’d forgotten about that. It’s been a while since I had last read that article.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>To search for&nbsp;typography inspiration I&nbsp;like the&nbsp;website It’s Nice That. They have more than just typography if&nbsp;you aren’t into that. <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/media/typography." target="_blank">https://www.itsnicethat.com/media/typography.</a></p>

<p class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Claire! You all should have your favorite sites to see design too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>For this week, I&nbsp;was interested in&nbsp;seeing how&nbsp;they make a&nbsp;font and&nbsp;found this cool article with the&nbsp;steps: <a href="https://typetype.org/blog/creating-a-font-from-scratch-a-detailed-guide-and-tips-for-choosing-software/" target="_blank">https://typetype.org/blog/creating-a-font-from-scratch-a-detailed-guide-and-tips-for-choosing-software/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Tyler! Great article that shows why you should <em>not</em> make your own font.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I also just found the&nbsp;process of&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;pixel font fun&nbsp;and I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;try experimenting with other pixel sizes. I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;an interesting challenge to&nbsp;try and&nbsp;create fonts with both extremely limited pixels (like 3&nbsp;maybe?) and&nbsp;many&nbsp;pixels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Those are interesting exercises. Especially for those who are talking about designing a “real font”. Try one with 24 or 36 pixels. And instead of only black and white, you can use one or two shades of gray to smoothen the curves.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I want to&nbsp;investigate what the&nbsp;smallest number of&nbsp;pixels would be&nbsp;until a&nbsp;pixel font is&nbsp;considered&nbsp;useless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Take a look at <a href="https://joefatula.com/twoslice.html" target="_blank">Two Slice, “a font that’s only 2px tall, and somewhat readable!” </a></p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I also learned when doing pixel fonts, it’s better to&nbsp;sketch out&nbsp;the whole word first then go&nbsp;back and&nbsp;tweak&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">We’ll work on your ability to produce a useful draft fast.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I am&nbsp;going to&nbsp;start researching the&nbsp;font I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do for&nbsp;the booklet&nbsp;project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Good idea! Here’s the <a href="https://grc-ribeiro.github.io/grc322-2262/assignments-p9-type-specimen-pamphlet.html" target="_blank">assignment instructions</a>. I plan on changing it to 16 pages, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>It is&nbsp;very difficult to&nbsp;chose a&nbsp;designer or&nbsp;even 5&nbsp;I&nbsp;was interested in, I&nbsp;liked a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s the idea! I thought about maybe choosing my favorite five from that list, but that gave some anxiety, so I didn’t even try it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I overheard that Bruno was&nbsp;in a&nbsp;punk band. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;cool to&nbsp;hear some of&nbsp;the songs : )</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">😎 🎸🤘</p>
