<h1>Class journal, module 1 </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Additionally, seeing how&nbsp;the metro plan was&nbsp;created, reminded me&nbsp;of a&nbsp;German saying which translates to&nbsp;“Designing means rejecting ideas”. I&nbsp;think that is&nbsp;something one&nbsp;has to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind when creating designs: it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;a linear process but&nbsp;one that goes in&nbsp;cycles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s a nice quote too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I don’t think I’ve played enough video games to&nbsp;design a&nbsp;pixelated&nbsp;font.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">And whose fault is that?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>So far&nbsp;this was&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my favorite lab&nbsp;projects I’ve done! Felt super simple but&nbsp;there was&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;room to&nbsp;be creative and&nbsp;try something new&nbsp;for the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s nice to hear! The results were really good!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Being intentional with any&nbsp;design goes a&nbsp;long&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes. Ask yourself why you’re making every choice you make.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Good design takes hard work, critique, and&nbsp;improvement. It&nbsp;does not&nbsp;appear out&nbsp;of thin air&nbsp;or on&nbsp;the first&nbsp;try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Correct. Several of you had to start over your pixel fonts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Instead of&nbsp;spending a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time tweaking one&nbsp;part, try&nbsp;to put&nbsp;something down for&nbsp;all parts. Then, go&nbsp;back and&nbsp;edit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Yes! And then edit more! Spend hours sweating the small details if you need to, because it’s worth it. But first, have a rough draft to test what details are worth spending those hours on.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>The video about the&nbsp;metro plan in&nbsp;Oslo was&nbsp;very interesting as&nbsp;you were able to&nbsp;see that to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;new design you&nbsp;don’t have to&nbsp;start entirely from scratch. Elements that worked before, can&nbsp;also work in&nbsp;a new&nbsp;design if&nbsp;they are&nbsp;coherent with the&nbsp;other&nbsp;elements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Exactly. Another quote that I like is “Innovate as your last resource.” Also&nbsp;by Charles&nbsp;Eames.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>After watching the&nbsp;video of&nbsp;the metro maps, I&nbsp;thought this article was&nbsp;really interesting. It&nbsp;goes through the&nbsp;best designed maps and&nbsp;how different they all&nbsp;look from each other while keeping the&nbsp;good aspects that people know and&nbsp;can recognize: <a href="https://glantz.net/blog/the-worlds-best-designed-metro-maps/" target="_blank">https://glantz.net/blog/the-worlds-best-designed-metro-maps/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s cool. Thanks for sharing, Tyler! Keep in mind, everybody, that every good designer is a design nerd.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Any good books on&nbsp;design or&nbsp;design history that you’d&nbsp;recommend?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">You can start here: <a href="https://www.brunoribeiro.com/books/" target="_blank">https://www.brunoribeiro.com/books/</a></p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I also realized that I&nbsp;should learn the&nbsp;names of&nbsp;more designers because I&nbsp;don’t really know any&nbsp;by&nbsp;name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">That’s one thing that I should be learning from the students, not the other way around.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I recently watched this episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCfBYE97rFk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCfBYE97rFk</a> on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the designers listed for&nbsp;the next project, Paula Scher, and&nbsp;it brought to&nbsp;my attention important impacts that type can&nbsp;have on&nbsp;society. Type can&nbsp;have economic impacts. It&nbsp;is mentioned how&nbsp;brands need to&nbsp;live and&nbsp;die by&nbsp;their typeface choice. A&nbsp;notable example is&nbsp;Gap changing its&nbsp;iconic serif typeface to&nbsp;a Helvetica typeface, which received immediate backlash from the&nbsp;public, prompting them to&nbsp;change it&nbsp;back within a&nbsp;week. The&nbsp;documentary also mentions the&nbsp;political impact that typography can&nbsp;have and&nbsp;brings up&nbsp;the example of&nbsp;the 2000 “butterfly ballet” in&nbsp;Florida, which had&nbsp;a confusing layout and&nbsp;bad typographical hierarchy that may&nbsp;have led&nbsp;people to&nbsp;vote for&nbsp;the wrong person, likely altering the&nbsp;outcome of&nbsp;the close election and&nbsp;changing the&nbsp;course of&nbsp;American history. This documentary really instilled the&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;how typography can&nbsp;ultimately determine how&nbsp;we navigate the&nbsp;world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Nick! You should all watch it. Also, watch the movies <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847817/" target="_blank">“Helvetica”</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1241325/" target="_blank">“Objectified”</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>A font is&nbsp;the actual file, while a&nbsp;typeface is&nbsp;the&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Correct. But we do call the assignment “pixel font”, because that’s how it’s called. Nobody calls pixel fonts “pixel typefaces”.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I remember watching a&nbsp;video about LCD&nbsp;screens and&nbsp;numbers and&nbsp;types of&nbsp;number grids for&nbsp;small simple screens, think calculators and&nbsp;microwaves, and&nbsp;this project really reminded me&nbsp;of it. In&nbsp;the video the&nbsp;guy made multiple number grids and&nbsp;showed the&nbsp;number systems he&nbsp;made. I&nbsp;can’t find the&nbsp;video, I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;look for&nbsp;it better but&nbsp;I&nbsp;remember it&nbsp;being really well done and&nbsp;interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Microwaves is a good example of low-res typography. (Not exactly pixel, but similar challenge.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I’d like to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;typeface bold, I&nbsp;think a&nbsp;bolder pixel font looks&nbsp;better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Who’s stopping you?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>I’m interested to&nbsp;see how&nbsp;difficult it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;using the&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;12 square heights but&nbsp;also if&nbsp;it will provide me&nbsp;with more freedom in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">They both will be harder than 9 pixels in their own way.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Only 3–6PM gets candy. Take 3–6PM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="classjournal">Correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
    <p>Today’s class was&nbsp;like a&nbsp;puzzle, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;puzzles.</p>
