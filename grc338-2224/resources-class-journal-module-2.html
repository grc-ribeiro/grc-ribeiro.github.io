<h1>Class journal, module 2  </h1>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I had&nbsp;used brackets before in&nbsp;an earlier GrC&nbsp;class but&nbsp;it is&nbsp;now much more comprehensive with the&nbsp;digestible explanations we&nbsp;learned in&nbsp;lecture and&nbsp;lab. GrC&nbsp;338 is&nbsp;my favorite class this&nbsp;quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Once I&nbsp;got the&nbsp;hang of&nbsp;formatting the&nbsp;menu it&nbsp;started to&nbsp;become lowkey&nbsp;satisfying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It feels somewhat empowering, doesn’t it?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I need to&nbsp;remember to&nbsp;include the&nbsp;exclamation point in&nbsp;<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</code> and&nbsp;typing this out&nbsp;right now&nbsp;will hopefully help me&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If you type <code>html:5</code> and tab on VS Code, it populates the document for you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;investigate the&nbsp;settings of&nbsp;my coding software and&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;remove the&nbsp;automatic end&nbsp;tag because it&nbsp;was making be&nbsp;frustrated during the&nbsp;coding&nbsp;process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’re not alone. I found the solution (a day too late).</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I would like to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;text editor that works for&nbsp;me! My&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;a software engineer so&nbsp;I&nbsp;asked him&nbsp;which one&nbsp;would be&nbsp;good for&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;hopefully by&nbsp;next lab&nbsp;I&nbsp;found one&nbsp;that works :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I think we have Brackets, BBEdit, and VS&nbsp;Code in the computer labs. Several students like Sublime, but it’s not free.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Shoutout to&nbsp;Kylie Wong for&nbsp;showing me&nbsp;Notion and&nbsp;all the&nbsp;cool things it&nbsp;can do&nbsp;to help organize all&nbsp;your to&nbsp;do’s. Shoutout to&nbsp;Allison for&nbsp;introducing me&nbsp;to Trello, I&nbsp;will now&nbsp;be using that to&nbsp;keep track of&nbsp;all my&nbsp;assignments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There were some intense debate about best productivity tools in the Monday evening lab. I loved it. (As long as everybody stays kind to each other, that is. Which they did, of course.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Group work is&nbsp;fun and&nbsp;I’m happy we&nbsp;get to&nbsp;work together and&nbsp;meet new&nbsp;people in&nbsp;this class. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;times, I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;never get&nbsp;to know many people in&nbsp;my classes and&nbsp;today I&nbsp;felt like I&nbsp;met new&nbsp;people and&nbsp;got to&nbsp;communicate and&nbsp;learn new&nbsp;things about each&nbsp;other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">In the last quarter before Covid, a student said that the best part of the design principles assignment was that they got to know other students, which made it easier to ask for help when you’re stuck in your code. It made me really happy, because I&nbsp;didn’t design the assignment with that in mind.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also learned about working through projects with your peers and&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;helping your neighbors when they need an&nbsp;extra eye&nbsp;or are&nbsp;stuck on&nbsp;a&nbsp;section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">During lockdown, the collaboration in the lab was what I missed the most. I’m glad it came back stronger than before.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Today I&nbsp;learned that classmates are&nbsp;incredibly helpful! It’s important to&nbsp;ask for&nbsp;help and&nbsp;make sure to&nbsp;use each other as&nbsp;resources!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct. What makes a good program is good students, not good teachers. You’re surrounded by good students, don’t waste this opportunity!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Working with Chase and&nbsp;Owen was&nbsp;helpful and&nbsp;reassuring because we&nbsp;could double check that we&nbsp;had included&nbsp;everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s the idea. This week, you’ll have different partners.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Anjali helped me&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;with putting my&nbsp;code that was&nbsp;in Brackets into GitHub, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;am very appreciative of&nbsp;that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always nice to hear!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>HUGE shoutout to&nbsp;Tanya, she&nbsp;is the&nbsp;most knowledgeable student I&nbsp;have ever&nbsp;met.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Well deserved. Tanya seems to be great indeed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that the&nbsp;people around me&nbsp;are valuable resources for&nbsp;helping (Taylor and&nbsp;Zara helped me&nbsp;a lot).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Keep sending the shoutouts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Katrina Lin&nbsp;is a&nbsp;lifesaver. She&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;install an&nbsp;extension that helped me&nbsp;code a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please, share.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Tanya helped me&nbsp;with the&nbsp;lab assignment and&nbsp;also posting it&nbsp;to GitHub !!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m going to get it out of the way and give Tanya the first Twix of the quarter for helping.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Taylor helped me&nbsp;with my&nbsp;restaurant&nbsp;menu!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Taylor Tran got her Twix too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found <a href="https://www.htmlgoodies.com/html/the-html-hierarchy-thinking-inside-the-box/" target="_blank">this resource</a> but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am curious about some of&nbsp;the other tags mentioned like division&nbsp;elements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Caela! (We’ll get to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag soon.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There are&nbsp;countless apps and&nbsp;games to&nbsp;help people learn to&nbsp;code. I&nbsp;went on&nbsp;the App&nbsp;Store and&nbsp;searched for&nbsp;coding games and&nbsp;I&nbsp;found many fun&nbsp;options like Yolmo, Mimo, Sololearn….</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t know them. But thanks for sharing, Kylie!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that HTML Formatter is&nbsp;a great way&nbsp;to organize your code and&nbsp;that there are&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of other resources to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It helps me read your files, but also helps you catch your mistakes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that unordered list does not&nbsp;mean everything in&nbsp;the list gets jumbled&nbsp;around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I guess it makes sense that you thought it was the case. But I’ve never had a student confused by that before. You could tell I&nbsp;was confused by your question too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;find out&nbsp;if there is&nbsp;an easier way&nbsp;to format all&nbsp;of the&nbsp;text into list items and&nbsp;each line into paragraph tags or&nbsp;h4 tags without doing it&nbsp;one by&nbsp;one. There’s gotta be&nbsp;a way&nbsp;right… right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There’s always a different way. I&nbsp;like to write in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> and export as HTML in <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" target="_blank">BBEdit</a>. Some people prefer <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/" target="_blank">Emmet&nbsp;abbreviations</a> in VS&nbsp;Code. Others think these tools only add a layer of complexity.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;quite confused about making a&nbsp;list… shoutout to&nbsp;Bruno for&nbsp;reminding me&nbsp;that a&nbsp;list is&nbsp;“more than one&nbsp;item.” Whoops! Sorry Bruno, will never happen&nbsp;again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. A list is more than one item.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m still a&nbsp;bit confused about why&nbsp;we copy and&nbsp;paste the&nbsp;<code>&lt;meta…/&gt;</code> code at&nbsp;the top. Will we&nbsp;go into this later in&nbsp;the quarter or&nbsp;for the&nbsp;time being do&nbsp;we just accept that it’s a&nbsp;necessary piece of&nbsp;the&nbsp;code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t fully understand them, but that’s what I found as recommendation to fight GitHub’s aggressive caching.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Only list items can&nbsp;be in&nbsp;lists, but&nbsp;a list item can&nbsp;contain many different kinds of&nbsp;items.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m curious what the&nbsp;HTML code is&nbsp;to customize the&nbsp;font and&nbsp;color.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’re getting there this week. But it’s CSS, not HTML.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Always make your files an&nbsp;<code>index.html</code>!!!! this was&nbsp;something I&nbsp;missed and&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;forget for&nbsp;next&nbsp;time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;copy and&nbsp;paste&nbsp;everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes! I mean not <em>everything</em>, but yes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned to&nbsp;always double check you&nbsp;spelled your file names correctly when uploading to&nbsp;GitHub. Especially the&nbsp;class number….</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Or… You can copy and paste as I suggested.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Found out&nbsp;that Koberl at&nbsp;Blue is&nbsp;a real restaurant in&nbsp;SLO and&nbsp;now I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;go get&nbsp;a nice Pan&nbsp;Roasted Chicken Breast and&nbsp;Chocolate Lava&nbsp;Cake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s a real, expensive restaurant in Downtown.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that Tom&nbsp;is an&nbsp;outstanding&nbsp;dancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Tom can&nbsp;do a&nbsp;backflip and&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;impressive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">First time I saw him doing it was on a rehearsal for that dance that you saw. I noticed he was stepping out of stage area and wondered why. Then he came and did the backflip. Almost killed me then. And every time since.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Tom is&nbsp;a very talented dancer!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks! I think so too. But I’m quite biased.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Also, I&nbsp;saw you&nbsp;on the&nbsp;bus&nbsp;today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I do take the 4A bus most days.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Lastly… I’m curious about programming languages and&nbsp;English. When I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Spain, I&nbsp;met a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;programmers who&nbsp;said that native English-speaking programmers have it&nbsp;easy because most programming languages are&nbsp;in English. If&nbsp;you’ve considered this before, what do&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;say about it? Is&nbsp;that&nbsp;true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I wouldn’t go as far as say that native English-speakers have it easy. Maybe easier, because it may be easier to memorize. But it’s not like you can just write in plain English and expect it to work. You still have to learn the syntax of each programming language.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Great week overall :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let’s make the next even better!</p>
