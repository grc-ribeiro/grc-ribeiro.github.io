  <p>I’m still trying to&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;content from the&nbsp;short videos. There are&nbsp;aspects of&nbsp;the code that I&nbsp;don’t quite&nbsp;understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Two words for you: <a href="https://calendly.com/bruno-ribeiro/office-hours" target="_blank">office hours</a>. I’ll be happy to help!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I appreciate that you&nbsp;make files along with your tutorials so&nbsp;we can&nbsp;follow along, they are&nbsp;very helpful. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Several of you wrote similar comments! I’m glad it’s working! Thanks for the feedback!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Found out&nbsp;I&nbsp;spelled <code>div.container</code> wrong… So&nbsp;embarrassing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not embarrassing at all. But the mistake was not to misspell it. The mistake was to type it at all. Always copy and paste to avoid such mistakes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Always keep the&nbsp;same navigation on&nbsp;all pages; you&nbsp;need to&nbsp; include a&nbsp;link to&nbsp;the page that you’re viewing the&nbsp;page itself, even if&nbsp;it seems&nbsp;redundant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In regards to&nbsp;navigation, our&nbsp;mental model tells us&nbsp;that the&nbsp;logo present on&nbsp;any site is&nbsp;a link to&nbsp;home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Then, you don’t need “Home” in your main nav.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The concept of&nbsp;visibility made me&nbsp;think of&nbsp;how lights are&nbsp;used to&nbsp;indicate Bluetooth mode or&nbsp;low battery mode for&nbsp;speakers. I&nbsp;use Bluetooth speakers and&nbsp;headphones on&nbsp;a daily basis, and&nbsp;I’ve always wished there was&nbsp;a more clear battery level indication on&nbsp;some minimalist Bluetooth devices. I&nbsp;was actually thinking throughout the&nbsp;week how&nbsp;having more visibility to&nbsp;indicate battery level would have improved my&nbsp;user&nbsp;experience!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Oh, don’t get me started on the usability of Bluetooth earphones. The lack of buttons is terrible too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;glad to&nbsp;know that my&nbsp;automation theory is&nbsp;correct. There are&nbsp;plenty of&nbsp;things that people do&nbsp;repetitiously that could be&nbsp;automated. Deckset looks awesome. I&nbsp;know a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;engineers (and professors) who&nbsp;could use&nbsp;something to&nbsp;design their slides for&nbsp;them. I&nbsp;have been getting into those sorts of&nbsp;things over the&nbsp;past couple of&nbsp;months. For&nbsp;example, I&nbsp;have executables that will set&nbsp;up my&nbsp;computer in&nbsp;the morning, for&nbsp;various specific tasks, and&nbsp;will close everything I&nbsp;don’t need, open my&nbsp;notes, and&nbsp;connect me&nbsp;to the&nbsp;class Zoom when I&nbsp;click on&nbsp;them. Another example is&nbsp;that I&nbsp;have installed Brew, allowing me&nbsp;to install, update, and&nbsp;execute apps from the&nbsp;terminal. My&nbsp;favorite is&nbsp;one that lets me&nbsp;position windows using the&nbsp;keyboard (such as&nbsp;Control-Option-A to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;window on&nbsp;the left two-thirds of&nbsp;the screen and&nbsp;Control-Option-E to&nbsp;put another on&nbsp;the right one-third). My&nbsp;biggest thing right now&nbsp;is that I&nbsp;am still trying to&nbsp;find something that will let&nbsp;me use&nbsp;AutoCorrect in&nbsp;any app&nbsp;or text field (it does not&nbsp;work on&nbsp;things like Slack, Discord, Signal, or&nbsp;Adobe apps).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t think I can help you with the AutoCorrect, but I have other tools for you to check out. First, I cannot function without <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro</a>. For positioning windows, I use <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/" target="_blank">Moom</a>. Another tool you may want to check is <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>; it makes my process to upload files to GitHub much easier. I have <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> installed, but only to convert <a href="assignments-1-dpw-1-design-principles.text">my text files</a> from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> to <a href="assignments-1-dpw-1-design-principles.html">an HTML page</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The smallest things can&nbsp;make the&nbsp;whole code not&nbsp;work. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;frustrating at&nbsp;times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I highly recommend downloading <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> to check your work. You can see the source code on any browser, but with Firefox highlights the errors in red type. It also helps with the grid structure too. I use Safari for my normal browsing, but Firefox is the one I use for web development. (<del>Fun</del> Nerdy fact: back in the 00s, we all used Firefox because it was the first to feature tabs instead of a new window for every page open.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;learning to&nbsp;visualize my&nbsp;designs in&nbsp;a sketch before&nbsp;coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not a bad idea!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like the&nbsp;progressive disclosure example with the&nbsp;product information which unfolds on&nbsp;the package. I&nbsp;have an&nbsp;abundance of&nbsp;food allergies and&nbsp;it can&nbsp;be difficult to&nbsp;read some of&nbsp;the ingredient information on&nbsp;certain packages. The&nbsp;“Contains: Wheat, soy, egg” line can&nbsp;be helpful, but&nbsp;it can&nbsp;also be&nbsp;deceitful. I&nbsp;am allergic to&nbsp;most soy, but&nbsp;not soy&nbsp;lecithin, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;often have to&nbsp;read through it&nbsp;anyway to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;“soy” means just lecithin or&nbsp;something like soy&nbsp;protein as&nbsp;well. There have also been several times when I&nbsp;have seen something like “Contains: Wheat” which supposedly means that does not&nbsp;have other common allergies, but&nbsp;then it&nbsp;has soy&nbsp;or something prominently in&nbsp;the ingredients when I&nbsp;look through&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Several principles such as entry point, hierarchy, and highlighting can help with the display of this important information. We’ll talk about accessibility in week 8, which is a big point of this class. And a big part of it is inclusivity. A person with food allergy should feel included in the design of the packaging. It cannot be an afterthought.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Through this assignment, I&nbsp;learned to&nbsp;have more patience with myself not&nbsp;give up&nbsp;so easily coding can&nbsp;be frustrating but&nbsp;when it&nbsp;works I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Also, don’t forget to take breaks when you need them. It’s much easier to find a missing semicolon when you stop staring at your code for so long.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I especially liked the&nbsp;wayfinding example with the&nbsp;metal arrows on&nbsp;the corner of&nbsp;the wall and&nbsp;icons directing them. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;beautiful design and&nbsp;was also effective in&nbsp;its goal of&nbsp;navigating&nbsp;individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I did too!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also appreciate getting to&nbsp;collaborate with other students on&nbsp;assignments. I&nbsp;like being able to&nbsp;message a&nbsp;friend and&nbsp;ask how&nbsp;they problem solved an&nbsp;item I&nbsp;might have misunderstood. Even with virtual class, there are&nbsp;still ways to&nbsp;collaborate with fellow students/friends like we&nbsp;would if&nbsp;we were in&nbsp;person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s great news! I wish you were using the virtual collaboration discussion more often, but at least it’s good to know that there’s collaboration happening!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I had&nbsp;a really great group this week! It&nbsp;is always refreshing to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;collaborate, connect and&nbsp;be on&nbsp;the same page. We&nbsp;got our&nbsp;examples done easily and&nbsp;coordinated well to&nbsp;submit. I&nbsp;appreciated&nbsp;that!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Several of you wrote similar things. Really happy to hear it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Sometimes I’m finding that connecting with my&nbsp;Example group for&nbsp;the week is&nbsp;easy and&nbsp;other times we&nbsp;are very much not&nbsp;on the&nbsp;same page. It&nbsp;is interesting to&nbsp;see how&nbsp;different the&nbsp;group dynamic is&nbsp;from week to&nbsp;week based on&nbsp;who’s in&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Like everything else in life.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Feedback principle would be&nbsp;a very interesting topic to&nbsp;learn about as&nbsp;a design principle. A&nbsp;google search showed me&nbsp;that feedback answers questions in&nbsp;four categories: Location, Current Status, Future Status, and&nbsp;Outcome &amp; Results. These came from David Hogue’s Interaction Design&nbsp;principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I wouldn’t call all of them feedback. To me it’s Current Status and Outcome. But thanks for sharing the <a href="http://www.idux.com/downloads/MAX2010_HOGUE_Interaction_Design_Principles.pdf" target="_blank">resource</a>, Sinjin!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have found it&nbsp;really helpful to&nbsp;write down the&nbsp;definitions of&nbsp;the principles we&nbsp;covered that week in&nbsp;my journal so&nbsp;I&nbsp;can remember them, since I&nbsp;only worked on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the four principles for&nbsp;our examples/discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Makes sense. Would you try to write concisely but with your own words?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The design principles are&nbsp;now content that I&nbsp;haven’t heard of&nbsp;and really interested by. I&nbsp;have thought of&nbsp;these principles or&nbsp;applied them but&nbsp;didn’t know the&nbsp;proper term or&nbsp;could acknowledge that I&nbsp;was using any&nbsp;of them so&nbsp;they are&nbsp;really eye&nbsp;opening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It happens a lot with the principles. They’re not very surprising. But by reading them, you now can make decisions more consciously and explain them better.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The Tesla disclosure example was&nbsp;additionally accurate. However, I&nbsp;feel like it&nbsp;discloses too&nbsp;little information at&nbsp;a time. While it&nbsp;is important to&nbsp;not overload, I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;see what’s going on&nbsp;with what I&nbsp;am operating especially when I&nbsp;am&nbsp;driving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s why I like the Trello example better; it shows a lot of information without being overwhelming. It’s a trade-off and finding the balance can be hard sometimes, but those who read these comments every week know that <strong>to design is to make decisions</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The wayfinding topic, especially orientation was&nbsp;interesting to&nbsp;me. It&nbsp;made me&nbsp;think of&nbsp;theme park maps and&nbsp;how even though parks, like Six&nbsp;Flags Magic Mountain, don’t have a&nbsp;south-facing entrance the&nbsp;map makers still make the&nbsp;“south” of&nbsp;the map&nbsp;the entrance so&nbsp;that the&nbsp;user understands the&nbsp;map to&nbsp;world&nbsp;relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It fits our mental model.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I spent three days trying to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;why my&nbsp;links weren’t working even though I&nbsp;checked my&nbsp;HTML code over and&nbsp;over and&nbsp;over again. Turns out&nbsp;that even though my&nbsp;live preview was&nbsp;enabled, I&nbsp;just didn’t save my&nbsp;HTML files. Rookie mistake, this won’t happen again:).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is a rookie mistake, but also a generation issue. For people my age, who didn’t grow up with auto-save, hitting <code>⌘-S</code> every five minutes or so is second nature.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week I&nbsp;discovered that if&nbsp;multiple HTML pages use&nbsp;the same image there must be&nbsp;multiple copies in&nbsp;the folder. You&nbsp;cannot simply have one&nbsp;to cover all&nbsp;the&nbsp;pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s absolute <strong>not</strong> the case. If you use the same image in several pages, you want to use one file only.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also had&nbsp;issues with uploading to&nbsp;GitHub because my&nbsp;links weren’t working and&nbsp;images weren’t showing up, even though they were showing up&nbsp;fine when I&nbsp;had the&nbsp;index.html opened up&nbsp;from my&nbsp;desktop. Then, I&nbsp;realized that GitHub takes a&nbsp;few minutes for&nbsp;things to&nbsp;load, so&nbsp;after about 20&nbsp;minutes everything was&nbsp;loading&nbsp;correctly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">True. It’s rather frustrating actually.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bold, all-caps type needs more spacing than lowercase&nbsp;type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">True. Use <code>em</code> for the <code>letter-spacing</code> CSS property.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I fixed my&nbsp;old website so&nbsp;that the&nbsp;text isn’t centered anymore. Centered text does not&nbsp;look as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;think it&nbsp;did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">First, you may be tempted to center type on a title page, because it’s the easy way to balance the layout. Resist. Left-aligned text is sometimes a challenge, but you’ll get to better results.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I thought wayfinding was&nbsp;very interesting because I&nbsp;never thought about the&nbsp;design put&nbsp;into&nbsp;signage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve never had a chance to work on a physical environment wayfinding system. I hope I do, though; it’s a fascinating area of visual communication.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This weeks design principles proved even more that so&nbsp;much of&nbsp;design can&nbsp;be invisible if&nbsp;done properly, but&nbsp;stands out&nbsp;if done poorly. It&nbsp;is rare that I&nbsp;notice great wayfinding, but&nbsp;whenever I&nbsp;encounter a&nbsp;poor job, it&nbsp;bothers me&nbsp;and I&nbsp;can become lost and&nbsp;frustrated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s very true. Most people won’t even notice if wayfinding (physical or digital) is well done. Most people will be frustrated if it’s poorly done.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think it&nbsp;is no&nbsp;coincidence that tv&nbsp;remotes have been used for&nbsp;so many design principles. It&nbsp;is something that people use&nbsp;everyday, and&nbsp;when it&nbsp;has poor or&nbsp;confusing design it&nbsp;can become frustrating and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am sure has&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;many people breaking remotes. I&nbsp;am happy to&nbsp;see that remotes have moved away from having a&nbsp;button for&nbsp;ever function and&nbsp;to have a&nbsp;simplier remote but&nbsp;a more functionable tv&nbsp;interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s true. Because TVs have evolved into better interfaces, it allowed the remotes to be simpler, enhancing the user experience.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You did&nbsp;forget to&nbsp;include Rock ’n’ Roll Radio on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the videos last week. You&nbsp;are forgiven. I&nbsp;noticed the&nbsp;emphasis on&nbsp;it for&nbsp;the analysis video this&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">When I saw your note last week, I checked my Premiere Pro file and noticed that my layer with the intro and the outro were muted. Thanks for letting me know!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;so tired I&nbsp;can’t remember what I&nbsp;learned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I hear you. It’s the beginning of week 7, the hardest week in the quarter system. We’ll get to the end of it soon, though.</p>
