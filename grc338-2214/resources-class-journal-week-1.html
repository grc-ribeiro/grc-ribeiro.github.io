<h1>Class journal, week 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Just because you&nbsp;are not&nbsp;naturally talented at&nbsp;a certain subject does not&nbsp;mean that you&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;that&nbsp;area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Very important point. It doesn’t need to come easily; it’s okay if you have to work hard for it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My favorite point that I&nbsp;learned this week was&nbsp;from the&nbsp;article “Why is&nbsp;so much of&nbsp;design school a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;time?”. I&nbsp;love how&nbsp;they say&nbsp;that your favorite person should not&nbsp;be the&nbsp;one that makes you&nbsp;feel good about yourself or&nbsp;your work but&nbsp;rather someone who&nbsp;challenges you&nbsp;and makes you&nbsp;question and&nbsp;reconsider it&nbsp;all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is a great article! When Professor Cezzar first shared it on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrRib/status/667870623356456960" target="_blank">I&nbsp;promised her</a> I’d assign it to all my future classes. More than five years later, I haven’t broken my promise.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Even though this is&nbsp;only the&nbsp;first week of&nbsp;the quarter, I’ve enjoyed this class! I&nbsp;really like the&nbsp;layout of&nbsp;it how&nbsp;we have 4&nbsp;design principles a&nbsp;week and&nbsp;then have the&nbsp;coding assignment(s) at&nbsp;the end&nbsp;of the&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve been teaching different versions of this class for ten years. And it’s my third time teaching this class in the pandemic alone. I miss the interaction in the lab, but it has worked really well.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;still a&nbsp;little confused as&nbsp;of the&nbsp;structure of&nbsp;this class. I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;can read the&nbsp;instructions over and&nbsp;I&nbsp;still don’t really understand whats&nbsp;required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I won’t claim my instructions are perfect; I’m always trying to make it more clear. Please let me know next time you find something unclear.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I appreciate the&nbsp;time that you&nbsp;have put&nbsp;into the&nbsp;look and&nbsp;flow of&nbsp;your course content. It&nbsp;really helps with navigation and&nbsp;working with the&nbsp;content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And I appreciate being appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I didn’t know how&nbsp;to take a&nbsp;proper screenshot on&nbsp;Mac, so&nbsp;now I&nbsp;have learned more on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They do look nice, don’t they?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that just jumping into a&nbsp;coding assignment is&nbsp;the best way&nbsp;for me&nbsp;to complete the&nbsp;assignment. I&nbsp;am normally intimidated by&nbsp;coding assignments since I&nbsp;believe coding is&nbsp;not one&nbsp;of my&nbsp;strong suits. But&nbsp;after learning how&nbsp;GitHub works and&nbsp;how simple it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;complete it&nbsp;I&nbsp;gave gained some&nbsp;confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’ll go step-by-step. Coding may just as well become one of your strong suits.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really liked the&nbsp;hierarchy example provided by&nbsp;group 9, which was&nbsp;a student’s notes. This made me&nbsp;realize that even when I&nbsp;take notes for&nbsp;classes, I&nbsp;am utilizing parent and&nbsp;child elements to&nbsp;organize my&nbsp;thinking. The&nbsp;hierarchical organization also plays a&nbsp;large role in&nbsp;my understanding of&nbsp;the contents of&nbsp;my&nbsp;notes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Hierarchical organization will be very important in this class.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The progression of&nbsp;the Cal&nbsp;Poly Farms logo was&nbsp;a great example of&nbsp;iteration. It&nbsp;effectively demonstrated the&nbsp;small changes that were made based on&nbsp;specific aspects of&nbsp;the&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It was indeed a great example.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;unsure of&nbsp;whether the&nbsp;groups we&nbsp;had this week are&nbsp;consistent throughout the&nbsp;quarter or&nbsp;if they are&nbsp;switching every&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You will be randomly assigned to a new group every week.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My goal for&nbsp;this class is&nbsp;to become more comfortable with designing content that is&nbsp;great to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;and friendly to&nbsp;people to&nbsp;use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Great! Because that’s my goal for you too!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned how&nbsp;to properly take a&nbsp;screenshot that will look nice and&nbsp;include a&nbsp;drop&nbsp;shadow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’re welcome. (And thanks in advance for taking nice screenshots for me to include in my video. Students deserve videos with nice images.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;eventually be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;code my&nbsp;portfolio instead of&nbsp;using the&nbsp;pre-made websites, such as&nbsp;adobe portfolio. Hopefully I&nbsp;can get&nbsp;a step closer to&nbsp;that goal throughout this&nbsp;course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You will. But I’m not sure if coding your own portfolio is worth it. We’ll be back at this topic in week 8.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I enjoy the&nbsp;format of&nbsp;this class and&nbsp;the assignments for&nbsp;this first week. It&nbsp;is nice to&nbsp;move from individual ideas to&nbsp;collaborative ideas and&nbsp;then to&nbsp;see what the&nbsp;whole class has&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with in&nbsp;the same topic or&nbsp;their&nbsp;own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I like to move from individual work to small groups to larger groups. Online discussion, however, is not the best environment to foster collaboration. This assignment works much better in the classroom, but this is the third time I’m teaching this class fully online and I’ve been really happy with the results I’ve seen.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Working collaboratively with groups in&nbsp;an asynchronous class is&nbsp;difficult because we&nbsp;are scrambling to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;contact and&nbsp;divide up&nbsp;work. Because only one&nbsp;person submits, I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea if&nbsp;they submitted it&nbsp;correctly and&nbsp;followed the&nbsp;directions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s not ideal. But you can check your group’s submission, can’t you? (Honest question. I’ve always assumed you could.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In GRC&nbsp;320, we&nbsp;did a&nbsp;discussion on&nbsp;the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, which was&nbsp;supposedly caused by&nbsp;somebody clicking the&nbsp;wrong option on&nbsp;a drop-down menu, which I&nbsp;thought was&nbsp;relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">In case you don’t know the story, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/screen-that-set-off-hawaii-false-missile-alert-2018-1" target="_blank">here’s what the Hawaiian Missile Crisis was</a>. We will talk about errors and recovering from errors again in week 8. Most human mistakes are design mistakes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>About the&nbsp;Aesthetic-usability effect, which is&nbsp;that “Aesthetic designs are&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;use than less-aesthetic designs.” (I had&nbsp;known/ encountered the&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;what looks good being perceived as&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;use, but&nbsp;was unaware that there was&nbsp;a term for&nbsp;the phenomenon).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">This will happen a lot with the principles. You may have noticed some of those phenomena, but you didn’t know their names. And one you learn their names, it’s easier for you to make and to explain your decisions. <strong>To design is to make decisions.</strong> You want to have good rationale for them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>As a&nbsp;designer, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;investigate further into aesthetic usability effect and&nbsp;see how&nbsp;this plays out&nbsp;in my&nbsp;own work in&nbsp;this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Another way to think about the principle is that users tend to perceive ugly things as harder to use. (And untrustworthy.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really liked the&nbsp;example of&nbsp;the use&nbsp;of aesthetics on&nbsp;the TurboTax website because that is&nbsp;most definitely a&nbsp;stressful and&nbsp;tricky process that anyone would be&nbsp;overwhelmed by. I&nbsp;didn’t ever think about how&nbsp;useful and&nbsp;stress-alleviating the&nbsp;use of&nbsp;graphics could be&nbsp;in terms of&nbsp;simplifying the&nbsp;whole process and&nbsp;making understanding easier. I&nbsp;like the&nbsp;concept of&nbsp;the aesthetic-usability effect. It&nbsp;gives relevance to&nbsp;our design work and&nbsp;incentive to&nbsp;always try&nbsp;and make things look&nbsp;better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I really like this principle for the exactly same reason!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My group had&nbsp;the topic of&nbsp;iteration; I&nbsp;never really knew that there was&nbsp;a difference between an&nbsp;iteration and&nbsp;evolution. Prior this this week, I&nbsp;thought that iterations could be&nbsp;created with changes in&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They can. But that’s not what the principle was about. So it’s important to really understand the principle beyond its title’s meaning in the dictionary or other contexts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One question I&nbsp;do have about this is, would you&nbsp;consider prototypes and&nbsp;iterations the&nbsp;same and&nbsp;if not, how&nbsp;do they differ? Could you&nbsp;say that a&nbsp;prototype is&nbsp;an iteration of&nbsp;a&nbsp;product?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">A series of prototypes in the same phase of prototyping are iterations. For example, for each of the backpacks in the video, we only saw one paper prototype, but I’m sure the designers tried different iterations (wider, thicker, longer flaps, etc.) before moving on the next phase.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Some concepts that are&nbsp;confusing to&nbsp;me still are&nbsp;the basic ways to&nbsp;visually represent hierarchy: trees, nests, and&nbsp;stairs. I&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;concept and&nbsp;why it&nbsp;is used on&nbsp;paper but&nbsp;if I&nbsp;were to&nbsp;do this/make one, I’d have some trouble forming the&nbsp;relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I think you’ll intuitively find the best solution to convey your hierarchy.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The evolution of&nbsp;a product/webpage is&nbsp;not considered part of&nbsp;the design iteration process. Iterations focus on&nbsp;repeating a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;operations until a&nbsp;specific result is&nbsp;achieved. This usually comes from testing multiple ideas and&nbsp;choosing the&nbsp;one that best meets the&nbsp;design&nbsp;requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Precisely.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The water quality testing example reminded me&nbsp;of a&nbsp;time when I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;23andMe DNA&nbsp;test. I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea what to&nbsp;do in&nbsp;the beginning but&nbsp;the packaging and&nbsp;instructions were so&nbsp;aesthetically laid out, it&nbsp;motivated me&nbsp;to figure out&nbsp;what to&nbsp;do!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Canvas look alright too. But there are other systems that we have to work on as faculty at Cal Poly that look awful. They look like they were designed 15 years ago, so we feel like we’re working on an ancient product and it’s hard to trust that it’ll work well.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There is&nbsp;a proper way&nbsp;to use&nbsp;aesthetics in&nbsp;a design: aesthetics should not&nbsp;hide flaws but&nbsp;actively enhance the&nbsp;user’s experience (like relieving stress or&nbsp;fatigue).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Absolutely! Good design is honest!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;excited for&nbsp;this class and&nbsp;am looking forward to&nbsp;learning more about these design principles and&nbsp;putting them to&nbsp;practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The design principles are really helpful, and the book is awesome.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>After this week, I&nbsp;am equally excited as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am terrified that I’d starting to&nbsp;learn code. I&nbsp;seriously struggled with using GitHub for&nbsp;creating “Hello World", and&nbsp;had to&nbsp;create 4&nbsp;repositories before I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;upload the&nbsp;link to&nbsp;the server. If&nbsp;this is&nbsp;only the&nbsp;first assignment, I&nbsp;am worried that I&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;remaining coding&nbsp;projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Pay attention to the details and you’ll be fine.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>GitHub is&nbsp;a useful platform to&nbsp;upload code and&nbsp;collaborate with other users. As&nbsp;a beginner to&nbsp;GitHub, the&nbsp;site’s capabilities are&nbsp;is a&nbsp;bit intimidating, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;can see&nbsp;how it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;build complex&nbsp;systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Don’t be intimidate by it. It’s like Photoshop; it can do much much more than we’ll need, but we’ll be fine just working on what we’re comfortable with.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using GitHub was&nbsp;also very interesting, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am looking forward to&nbsp;getting more comfortable using this tool throughout the&nbsp;quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You will.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Bruno uses the&nbsp;Aktiv Grotesk typeface in&nbsp;his website :) (I love this font, gotta have it).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s a very legible and functional type family! It’s available on <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk" target="_blank">Adobe Fonts</a> for you to use in the Adobe programs and on the web. Also, you can download some weights for free as a trial from <a href="https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/aktiv-grotesk" target="_blank">Dalton Maag’s website</a> in case you need it in other applications.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;learn about the&nbsp;nitty gritty parts of&nbsp;web design next. I&nbsp;am not&nbsp;very skilled in&nbsp;coding/ CSS, but&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;come out&nbsp;of this course proficient in&nbsp;those&nbsp;skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I look forward to seeing your work!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Optimistic about this course, hoping to&nbsp;learn more about website development and&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m optimistic about this class of students too! We’re off to a good start! <br />
&nbsp; <br />
Also, keep in mind that you can set up <a href="https://calendly.com/bruno-ribeiro/office-hours" target="_blank">office hours appointments</a> to ask questions, get help, or just say hello.</p>
