<h1>Class journal, week 2  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;wondering if&nbsp;there was&nbsp;a reason why&nbsp;certain assignments are&nbsp;open on&nbsp;a certain day&nbsp;of the&nbsp;week and&nbsp;not all&nbsp;at once - such as&nbsp;videos and&nbsp;assignments opening on&nbsp;a Thursday and&nbsp;journals on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Friday?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There is. First, I want you all to focus on the discussions and design principles examples in the beginning of the week. But it also gives me time to grade and give feedback before the next assignment is open, which is very important to me.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;really helpful how&nbsp;the examples could be&nbsp;carried over into the&nbsp;assignment… I’ve had&nbsp;some classes where that’s not&nbsp;the case, making the&nbsp;assignment&nbsp;harder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The goal, of course, is to help you learn, not to make you suffer.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that things <strong><em>will</em></strong> work if&nbsp;you just read the&nbsp;instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And if I remember correctly, you also learned that coming to my <a href="https://calendly.com/bruno-ribeiro/office-hours" target="_blank">office hours</a> can be quite helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I coded my&nbsp;first actual website! The&nbsp;only prior coding experience I’ve had&nbsp;was extremely stressful and&nbsp;the instructor made everyone feel like a&nbsp;failure. Once I&nbsp;started on&nbsp;the restaurant menu assignment, I&nbsp;felt in&nbsp;control and&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew what to&nbsp;do thanks to&nbsp;the videos and&nbsp;instructions. Now&nbsp;after its&nbsp;done, I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;myself and&nbsp;relieved that this experience was&nbsp;a positive&nbsp;one!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I too am proud of you and relieved that your experience was positive!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I had&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of fun&nbsp;with this project and&nbsp;I’m excited to&nbsp;learn and&nbsp;practice more with&nbsp;HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">A lot of you wrote something similar. You’re my people!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week I&nbsp;did find the&nbsp;restaurant menu assignment challenging, as&nbsp;coding is&nbsp;very new&nbsp;to me. I’m hoping I&nbsp;will feel more confident coding as&nbsp;the weeks&nbsp;progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You will. It is supposed to be challenging, of course, but I hope it wasn’t stressful. I don’t want you stressed or frustrated with the class. When there’s stress and frustration, there is no learning. If it becomes too challenging, please seek help from me or your peers.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week was&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of fun. It&nbsp;was really cool that we&nbsp;actually started coding on&nbsp;HTML. It&nbsp;was quite satisfying to&nbsp;complete the&nbsp;restaurant menu and&nbsp;see it&nbsp;appear on&nbsp;the&nbsp;webpage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is quite satisfying to have your webpage published.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Having the&nbsp;quizzes at&nbsp;the end&nbsp;of each lesson video motivated me&nbsp;to pay&nbsp;more attention to&nbsp;what you&nbsp;were teaching and&nbsp;also helped me&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;parts that were unclear to&nbsp;me. The&nbsp;common mistakes was&nbsp;really helpful to&nbsp;me and&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;finish my&nbsp;restaurant menu quicker with fewer mistakes. HTML seems a&nbsp;lot easier after going through little pieces of&nbsp;information at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Looks like the class is working well for you. I’m glad to know.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I will have to&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;another simple text editor that is&nbsp;not Brackets, would Sublime be&nbsp;an acceptable platform to&nbsp;use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sublime is great, but it’s definitely more expensive than I’d be comfortable with suggesting to my students. There are some free editors that are great. (I use the free version of <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/_" target="_blank">BBEdit</a> on my Mac. The paid version is not <em>that</em> expensive, but I just don’t need any of its extra features.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I enjoy having different groups each week because you&nbsp;get to&nbsp;meet new&nbsp;people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s even better in person! But that’s something else to look for in the fall. I know I look forward to meeting all my students I haven’t met in person.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found that it&nbsp;is quite difficult to&nbsp;coordinate with groups for&nbsp;the examples assignment. It&nbsp;is difficult to&nbsp;equally split up&nbsp;the work, and&nbsp;to ensure that each individual is&nbsp;on the&nbsp;same page in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the specifications/instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s far from great, I know. But remember, we’re still dealing with <em>emergency online environment</em> because of the pandemic. This class should not be fully online. The HTML/CSS part of it works somewhat well online, although I miss the natural peer&#8209;collaboration that I see in labs, but the discussions work much better in person, of course. Last spring, however, I decided that online discussion would be more beneficial than no discussion. And I still think I made the right decision then, so I kept it. (I can’t believe it’s already my third time teaching this class in the pandemic.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using the&nbsp;discussion thread to&nbsp;see other students had&nbsp;questions and&nbsp;everyone was&nbsp;offering solutions was&nbsp;great and&nbsp;helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please keep using it. I’ve been redirecting questions in my inbox to the virtual collaboration board.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Centered headings are&nbsp;generally not&nbsp;a good idea on&nbsp;webpages. Because we&nbsp;read left to&nbsp;right it&nbsp;makes most sense to&nbsp;have headings left-aligned, especially when it&nbsp;precedes paragraphs of&nbsp;text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Titles don’t need to&nbsp;be centered to&nbsp;look&nbsp;good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They absolutely don’t!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Although it&nbsp;is important to&nbsp;design and&nbsp;think outside of&nbsp;the box, I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;is even more important to&nbsp;keep these design principles (consistency, similarity, alignment, and&nbsp;proximity) in&nbsp;mind when designing anything in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;create the&nbsp;best&nbsp;outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is very important to think <em>inside</em> the box too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I find it&nbsp;interesting how&nbsp;elements closer together are&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;more alike just because of&nbsp;the closeness in&nbsp;distance vs&nbsp;the elements farther&nbsp;apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You sound surprised…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The soundboard was&nbsp;probably my&nbsp;favorite example. Although it&nbsp;can still be&nbsp;overwhelming to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;inputs it&nbsp;has, it&nbsp;still presents itself as&nbsp;approachable and&nbsp;well&nbsp;organized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I like that example too. It was from a student many years ago as is the majority of the examples that I use.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week’s design principles all&nbsp;felt similar to&nbsp;each other, especially because so&nbsp;many of&nbsp;the examples were similar. The&nbsp;use of&nbsp;the tv&nbsp;remote across different categories was&nbsp;interesting, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was stronger in&nbsp;proximity rather than similarity, but&nbsp;it shows that design can&nbsp;take into account multiple principles to&nbsp;more effectively produce its&nbsp;desired&nbsp;effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t know if it works better for proximity than similarity; they were both strong examples. But, yes, you do have to take into account multiple principles. And sometimes, you have to find a balance between favoring one principle over another. <strong>To design is to make decisions.</strong></p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really liked the&nbsp;remote control example for&nbsp;Similarity. I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;really clever product example and&nbsp;it is&nbsp;incredibly accurate – without similarity of&nbsp;shape and&nbsp;color, those remotes would be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;use&nbsp;efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It was a good example. And shows how much of similarity is actually about differentiation.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have learned to&nbsp;love the&nbsp;Universal Principles of&nbsp;Design book because I&nbsp;can learn all&nbsp;the key&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;design and&nbsp;how it&nbsp;relates to&nbsp;psychology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is indeed a great book.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One valuable resource I&nbsp;found for&nbsp;coding help was&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. There are&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;questions and&nbsp;answers on&nbsp;there that are&nbsp;super helpful for&nbsp;all different sorts of&nbsp;programming languages along with HTML and&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">A great resource indeed. Thanks for sharing, Brooke!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>An HTML document has&nbsp;two parts, the&nbsp;head which contains invisible but&nbsp;important information, and&nbsp;the body where all&nbsp;visible elements will be&nbsp;contained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And there’s no “neck”!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned about the&nbsp;common mistakes that are&nbsp;made when using lists and&nbsp;list items. When creating lists, it&nbsp;is important to&nbsp;remember that only list items can&nbsp;be nested inside a&nbsp;list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’re right! And the list of mistakes to avoid will grow to match the different skills you’ll learn.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that when nesting tags, you&nbsp;need to&nbsp;close the&nbsp;most recent tag&nbsp;first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, you do!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Text with the&nbsp;same hierarchy should have the&nbsp;same tag. There is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;limit to&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;times you&nbsp;could use&nbsp;a&nbsp;tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Accurate.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The videos introducing HTML were super helpful in&nbsp;breaking down exactly how&nbsp;everything works. I&nbsp;am definitely nervous about my&nbsp;abilities to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;start the&nbsp;HTML process, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am glad to&nbsp;have those videos as&nbsp;a basic&nbsp;resource.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’re going step by step. Don’t be nervous. Just make sure to ask questions as soon as it gets confused. (If it gets confused.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When you&nbsp;close a&nbsp;tag, it’s basically the&nbsp;same thing just starting it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<code>/</code>… I&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;thought of&nbsp;it as&nbsp;an open and&nbsp;closed book where I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;remember to&nbsp;close the&nbsp;tag when I&nbsp;was&nbsp;done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s a cool analogy…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You can&nbsp;put elements inside a&nbsp;list item, but&nbsp;only list items can&nbsp;be nested inside an&nbsp;unordered/ordered&nbsp;list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I can’t seem to emphasize it enough.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The use&nbsp;of proper markup tags and&nbsp;structure is&nbsp;important when coding in&nbsp;HTML. When coding in&nbsp;HTML, we&nbsp;should not&nbsp;be worried about styling and&nbsp;how the&nbsp;code looks on&nbsp;the browser because it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;styled using CSS&nbsp;later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Exactly!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think GitHub is&nbsp;a great way&nbsp;to learn code! There are&nbsp;so many projects already posted that I&nbsp;can learn&nbsp;from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s a great tip, Madison!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m still new&nbsp;to GitHub and&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;lot I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;learn about it, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;is something that is&nbsp;used in&nbsp;industry, so&nbsp;I’m excited to&nbsp;learn how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;it this&nbsp;quarter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’ll just use a small fraction of its capabilities. But it’s a good start, then you can expand your knowledge as needed or wanted.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I enjoyed learning about similarity in&nbsp;products because it&nbsp;allows me&nbsp;to notice and&nbsp;appreciate the&nbsp;design of&nbsp;objects (like TV&nbsp;remotes) that I’d often overlook. I’ve heard that “invisible design is&nbsp;the best design.” Would you&nbsp;agree with&nbsp;that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not necessarily, or not always. For some cases, yes; you don’t want the design in the way of someone accomplish a job. But good design can be more than invisible; it can delight without intruding. Which is much, much easier to be said than done.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I had&nbsp;so much fun&nbsp;working on&nbsp;the restaurant menu. Last year, we&nbsp;were introduced to&nbsp;brackets and&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;website, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;wasn’t exactly sure how&nbsp;each line in&nbsp;code corresponded to&nbsp;each line in&nbsp;the actual website. I&nbsp;also love recipes and&nbsp;eventually wanted to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;recipe book compiling my&nbsp;family’s recipes for&nbsp;a holiday&nbsp;together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’ll have a recipe webpage really soon.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really want to&nbsp;learn more about how&nbsp;to turn HTML into a&nbsp;fully styled web&nbsp;page. I&nbsp;know that CSS&nbsp;is the&nbsp;way to&nbsp;do it, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;yet know exactly how&nbsp;to turn HTML code into something professional-looking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It won’t take long. This week, you’ll style your restaurant menu page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>With every HTML and&nbsp;CSS course/work I’ve done on&nbsp;my own, I&nbsp;always learn something new&nbsp;that allows me&nbsp;to make better decisions when&nbsp;coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Me too!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Not sure if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;relevant to&nbsp;the assignment or&nbsp;if you’d like to&nbsp;talk more about this during an&nbsp;office hours meeting, but&nbsp;I’m curious to&nbsp;hear what your favorite examples of&nbsp;effective web&nbsp;design are, if&nbsp;you have&nbsp;any.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t know if I have a favorite, but I’ll mention Airbnb, Adobe&nbsp;Fonts, and Pentagram as examples of sites that I like for different reasons.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have discovered that I&nbsp;find coding to&nbsp;be pretty fun, despite the&nbsp;fact that what we&nbsp;did this week was&nbsp;fairly straightforward. Although it&nbsp;is frustrating when something doesn’t work and&nbsp;you can’t figure out&nbsp;why, it&nbsp;is very satisfying when you&nbsp;get in&nbsp;a rhythm, especially when you&nbsp;get to&nbsp;output something that looks&nbsp;complicated.</p>
