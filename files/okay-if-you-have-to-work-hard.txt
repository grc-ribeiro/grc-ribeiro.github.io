<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I&#39;m asked to give advice to students, the #1 piece of advice I give is this:<br><br>Just because a subject is hard for you (math/science/etc), that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re &quot;not cut out for it.&quot; You don&#39;t have to be a natural at your chosen subject. It&#39;s okay if you have to work hard.</p>&mdash; Katie Mack (@AstroKatie) <a href="https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/1335339925953187840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
