<h1>Class journal, module 6  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;your body and&nbsp;take&nbsp;breaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Because I’m so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;designing for&nbsp;8.5x11” (or smaller), it&nbsp;feels foreign to&nbsp;be designing for&nbsp;such a&nbsp;large canvas. I&nbsp;keep trying to&nbsp;remind myself about the&nbsp;different distances someone might read this poster&nbsp;from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It really is different.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;not too&nbsp;thrilled with my&nbsp;research posters. Graphic design really is&nbsp;not my&nbsp;thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s not true.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I never really thought about the&nbsp;specifics of&nbsp;designing posters of&nbsp;a certain size such as&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;your body text, heading, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Now you did. I was in my junior year in college when one of my favorite professors in college saw some of us designing a poster for another class. He told us: “Do you know how to design a poster? It’s not only enlarging a book cover.” It stuck with me.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think I&nbsp;was more stressed for&nbsp;this project than I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If you were stressed at all, then yes, you were more stressed than you had to be.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Making multiple good looking posters is&nbsp;hard!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I know. That’s what you signed up for, though. And I know you’re up to the task.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This was&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my favorite projects in&nbsp;GrC. Quick, intensive, intriguing, and&nbsp;with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;important design decisions to&nbsp;make. Also, lots of&nbsp;freedom to&nbsp;design. I&nbsp;enjoyed it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You have no idea how much it warms my heart. It is one my favorite projects among all the classes I’ve taught.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When you&nbsp;design a&nbsp;big poster you&nbsp;don’t just scale a&nbsp;smaller poster/design. For a big poster there are 3 levels of reading (10 ft, 3 ft, and 1 ft).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Exactly. Those three numbers are arbitrary, though. I think I’ve made them up. But that’s still how you should think about the poster.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>After working on&nbsp;this in&nbsp;class I&nbsp;had mental block so&nbsp;I&nbsp;changed scenery and&nbsp;was very productive at&nbsp;home!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sometimes it helps. You do miss the collaboration, but sometimes you need to move away from a windowless computer lab in an old concrete building.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned working on&nbsp;a lab&nbsp;assignment makes the&nbsp;train ride go&nbsp;by a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’re welcome. Let me know if you need extra assignment for your ride back.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;sad not&nbsp;getting to&nbsp;sit next to&nbsp;my group&nbsp;members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You get to make new friends, though!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I didn’t use&nbsp;transparency in&nbsp;my design but&nbsp;it was&nbsp;useful to&nbsp;learn about screen and&nbsp;multiply. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;use that in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Years ago, watching students work in this assignment, I realized that this knowledge was lacking. It’s quite helpful to know the modes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Transparency modes were very fun&nbsp;to play with. Instead of&nbsp;using screen for&nbsp;transparency on&nbsp;a dark background, I&nbsp;used multiply for&nbsp;a highlight color atop of&nbsp;a white letterform. It&nbsp;highlights the&nbsp;area on&nbsp;the letterform and&nbsp;slightly tints the&nbsp;background with the&nbsp;shape of&nbsp;the&nbsp;highlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Now you know what the modes are and how to use them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I unexpectedly liked the&nbsp;second poster I&nbsp;made much more than my&nbsp;first, which I&nbsp;was certain was&nbsp;my&nbsp;baby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The third might be even better.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I want to&nbsp;try more layouts because I&nbsp;don’t love the&nbsp;ones I&nbsp;made, but&nbsp;they will have to&nbsp;do for&nbsp;now. The&nbsp;grid was&nbsp;helpful as&nbsp;usual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Maybe coming with fresh eyes will help you. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s kind of&nbsp;intimidating starting with a&nbsp;blank page but&nbsp;I&nbsp;just took a&nbsp;deep breath and&nbsp;started by&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;grid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Never stare at the blank page. Dump content on it and make it look good.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week, I&nbsp;really struggled to&nbsp;find inspiration for&nbsp;my posters. While I&nbsp;like working with a&nbsp;grid, sometimes I&nbsp;feel really restricted and&nbsp;it blocks my&nbsp;creative process. I’m not&nbsp;super happy with what I’ve turned in, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think what I’ve designed is&nbsp;a good&nbsp;start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If you don’t like working with the grid, start without the grid and add it later to tight things up.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week’s assignment gave me&nbsp;a better understanding of&nbsp;how to&nbsp;experiment with color and&nbsp;text placements within different&nbsp;grids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad to hear it’s working.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Shout out&nbsp;to Michaela for&nbsp;the designer inspo (Max Huber).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Fantastic! Do look into inspiration. And do share them with your colleagues.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Shoutout to&nbsp;Alex Woon because he&nbsp;had some awesome&nbsp;ideas!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad you’re collaborating even in different groups.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Lab is&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;quieter when we’re all&nbsp;separated from the&nbsp;people we&nbsp;normally sit&nbsp;with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I hear it was very quiet because one specific student was at a conference. Their roommate said that even their house is a lot quieter. I’m&nbsp;not going to name names, though.</p>
