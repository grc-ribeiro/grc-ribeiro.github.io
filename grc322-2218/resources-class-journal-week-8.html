  <p>I was&nbsp;feeling under the&nbsp;weather this past week but&nbsp;this class is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;few that has&nbsp;been keeping me&nbsp;motivated throughout the&nbsp;quarter. I&nbsp;feel like it‚Äôs challenging me&nbsp;in a&nbsp;more fun&nbsp;than stressful&nbsp;way.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">I‚Äôm glad to hear. I too find this class quite fun to teach.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The tables assignment was&nbsp;actually super informative. I&nbsp;didn‚Äôt realize InDesign had&nbsp;so many table formatting capabilities, it&nbsp;is definitely information that is&nbsp;super useful for&nbsp;the&nbsp;future!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not many people know how helpful InDesign can be when you are designing a table.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When designing the&nbsp;table, I&nbsp;initially started trying to&nbsp;experiment with different color combinations, then I&nbsp;realized that I&nbsp;was putting too&nbsp;much focus on&nbsp;‚Äúoriginal‚Äù and&nbsp;drifting away from ‚Äúgood.‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I‚Äôm glad you figured that out.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week working on&nbsp;our type posters, it&nbsp;was helpful doing the&nbsp;in class critique so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;could ask&nbsp;you questions and&nbsp;get feedback we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;update our&nbsp;posters together in&nbsp;class rather than texting back and&nbsp;forth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You should ask more questions, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I found working with tables really cool. I&nbsp;love working with the&nbsp;different style categories in&nbsp;InDesign. So&nbsp;satisfying when you&nbsp;formulate the&nbsp;style you&nbsp;want and&nbsp;can just select and&nbsp;choose what elements you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be changed to&nbsp;that style. I&nbsp;did not&nbsp;know there was&nbsp;such thing as&nbsp;table styles. You&nbsp;learn something new&nbsp;everyday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is quite fun to work with all the possibilities of tables and styles in InDesign, isn‚Äôt it?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I know in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the other groups designs they were able to&nbsp;change the&nbsp;color of&nbsp;certain portions of&nbsp;a character to&nbsp;highlight the&nbsp;differences between the&nbsp;two fonts, and&nbsp;I‚Äôm definitely curious on&nbsp;how they did&nbsp;that!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I would duplicate the letter, and use the Pathfinder palette. You can also use masks for less destructive method.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I thought doing the&nbsp;table design would be&nbsp;difficult after the&nbsp;video, but&nbsp;you kind of&nbsp;get a&nbsp;hang of&nbsp;it, especially if&nbsp;you already know InDesign&nbsp;well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt difficult. It was supposed to be a easier assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When is&nbsp;InDesign going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;live collaboration&nbsp;function?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I‚Äôm sure Adobe has been working on it for years.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When working with a&nbsp;team on&nbsp;the design, it&nbsp;is critical to&nbsp;realize when certain things are&nbsp;just personal preference rather than beneficial to&nbsp;what the&nbsp;team is&nbsp;showing to&nbsp;accomplish. It&nbsp;was it&nbsp;was fairly helpful to&nbsp;keep reminding myself that I&nbsp;left my&nbsp;ego in&nbsp;the hallway. We&nbsp;still worked well together, of&nbsp;course, but&nbsp;it‚Äôs good to&nbsp;remember that it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;just about what you&nbsp;are happy&nbsp;with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, please do check your ego on the door. However‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt dismiss your personal preferences that quickly. You may want to think why they‚Äôre there.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What color schemes look best for&nbsp;an informational&nbsp;poster?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There‚Äôs no such rule. You only need to make it legible and interesting. We have some interesting color schemes with black/gold/silver as well as red/yellow and cyan/magenta/black. There have been several unsuccessful attempts to use color theory and rational approach to color palette. For example, colors have different vibration just like musical notes, right? So there was a theory that you could harmonize colors based on how music scales work. Sounds genius, right? Except that it doesn‚Äôt look great. In the end, color is very subjective and based on perception. Beyond contrast for legibility, you only need to be concerned with it looking good and conveying the right messages, because colors do have meanings, although not universal.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I don‚Äôt know if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;useful or&nbsp;not but&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a website with HTML code for&nbsp;when you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;generate a&nbsp;table.

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What is&nbsp;a situation where you&nbsp;would find yourself really needing to&nbsp;use&nbsp;GREP?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I use GREP every day for several of my automation scripts. But the most common scenarios are on big books or webpages. Also, GREP styles can be very helpful too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Any tips on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;prepare for&nbsp;the&nbsp;midterm?</p>

<p  class="classjournal">Look at everybody‚Äôs webpages and posters.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;midterm, what material should we&nbsp;study? Will there be&nbsp;questions about grep and&nbsp;questions on&nbsp;the video&nbsp;lectures?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It‚Äôll be on type comparison only. (Questions from the video lectures will be on the final exam.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Are there any&nbsp;type-specimen examples we&nbsp;can view&nbsp;online?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I put some examples of professional work on the <a href="https://grc-ribeiro.github.io/grc322-2218/assignments-p9-type-specimen-pamphlet.html" target="_blank">assignment instructions</a>. But I can share some examples from last year too. (It was the first time I gave this assignment, I think it went really well, even though it was remote.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;super excited for&nbsp;the type specimen project. I&nbsp;loved looking at&nbsp;all the&nbsp;examples in&nbsp;class and&nbsp;getting lots of&nbsp;creative ideas for&nbsp;my project. Just need to&nbsp;decide which typeface to&nbsp;use!</p>

<p  class="classjournal">I am too! Can‚Äôt wait to see what you all will do!</p>
