<h1>Class journal, week 3  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>According to&nbsp;Paul Rand, you&nbsp;shouldn’t try&nbsp;to be&nbsp;original, just try&nbsp;to be&nbsp;good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I had&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of fun&nbsp;doing the&nbsp;type comparison assignment for&nbsp;this week! When I&nbsp;first started the&nbsp;type comparison, it&nbsp;didn’t seem like there were many things that differed between [the typefaces], but&nbsp;I&nbsp;liked being able to&nbsp;analyze each character in&nbsp;a way&nbsp;that worked for&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If you call it fun, you’re my people.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m excited to&nbsp;see other group’s type comparison webpages. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;cool to&nbsp;see how&nbsp;other groups interpreted the&nbsp;similarities and&nbsp;differences and&nbsp;the examples they chose for&nbsp;the font in&nbsp;use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ll make sure to share all the websites.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have you&nbsp;some basic Markdown formatting before within certain pieces of&nbsp;software, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;have never actually converted it&nbsp;directly to&nbsp;HTML. I’ve just used it&nbsp;in places where you&nbsp;insert markdown code in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;post an&nbsp;announcement or&nbsp;instructions within other software or&nbsp;web&nbsp;interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Markdown is how I’ve written essentially all my HTML for the good part of the decade now, including all the assignments and this very page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>After going through the&nbsp;differences between Helvetica Neue and&nbsp;Aktiv Grotesk with my&nbsp;group in&nbsp;lab, the&nbsp;differences between the&nbsp;two typefaces became very apparent. I&nbsp;feel that working in&nbsp;a group was&nbsp;helpful because it&nbsp;allowed me&nbsp;to notice things in&nbsp;the two&nbsp;fonts that I&nbsp;might not&nbsp;have picked up&nbsp;on if&nbsp;I&nbsp;had been working&nbsp;alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s a project that I never tried as individual, because I believe that talking about the typefaces with your group really helps the process of discovering and explaining their similarities and differences.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I enjoyed the&nbsp;group collaboration. I’ve really missed being in&nbsp;person + getting to&nbsp;work with&nbsp;peers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes! I&nbsp;too have missed students&nbsp;collaborating. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Fonts in&nbsp;use is&nbsp;such fun&nbsp;site. Great for&nbsp;not only seeing font combinations but&nbsp;also finding a&nbsp;font you&nbsp;may&nbsp;like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It really is.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One thing I’m nervous about is&nbsp;using HTML and&nbsp;CSS in&nbsp;this class. I&nbsp;struggled a&nbsp;bit in&nbsp;GrC 338&nbsp;and I’ve already forgotten most of&nbsp;the steps and&nbsp;tricks I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;know. I&nbsp;feel like I’m starting from scratch again and&nbsp;it makes me&nbsp;anxious for&nbsp;the future of&nbsp;this class if&nbsp;we are&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be building upon the&nbsp;things we&nbsp;did in&nbsp;GrC&nbsp;338.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We won’t use HTML and CSS too much. But you must be able to build a simple webpage in your sleep.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Could you&nbsp;explain more about why&nbsp;you like to&nbsp;avoid title case for&nbsp;hierarchical items? It&nbsp;does bother me&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;when a&nbsp;lecture slide title is&nbsp;in title case and&nbsp;you are&nbsp;not sure if&nbsp;the term it&nbsp;contains is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;proper noun (like “Benefits Of&nbsp;Regex” where it&nbsp;might not&nbsp;be obvious if&nbsp;you should capitalize it&nbsp;in your notes because you&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;proper noun since you’ve never heard of&nbsp;it before). Is&nbsp;that the&nbsp;general&nbsp;idea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s exactly it. Title case is ambiguos and unnecessarily slows the reading.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that the&nbsp;most effective way&nbsp;to distinguish a&nbsp;header from body text is&nbsp;with space&nbsp;between.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Bold helps too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I liked the&nbsp;video about type hierarchy. Is&nbsp;there an&nbsp;objective way&nbsp;to evaluate how&nbsp;much space is&nbsp;too much when enforcing hierarchy between headers? I&nbsp;feel like I’ve been deciding on&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;white space to&nbsp;give very subjectively in&nbsp;the&nbsp;past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sorry, but subjectivity is the name of the game.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I never paid too&nbsp;much attention to&nbsp;my assigned fonts before this class, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t think I’ll ever see&nbsp;it the&nbsp;same&nbsp;again!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">No, you won’t.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;reminded that Bruno doesn’t like centered text on&nbsp;websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Or anywhere. It’s lazy at best.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’ve learned that the&nbsp;intended use&nbsp;of a&nbsp;typeface at&nbsp;its inception is&nbsp;not necessarily the&nbsp;purpose it&nbsp;will end&nbsp;up serving in&nbsp;the future. Both of&nbsp;the fonts I&nbsp;researched were designed with certain situations in&nbsp;mind, yet&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;being utilized in&nbsp;entirely separate&nbsp;ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s an interesting observation. It&nbsp;happens with other products and services too. Twitter, for example, was created for you to share what you were doing, not what you were thinking.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The heading of&nbsp;a left-aligned paragraph should be&nbsp;aligned to&nbsp;the left, on&nbsp;the same margin as&nbsp;the paragraph it’s&nbsp;heading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>While working on&nbsp;our type comparison website I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit confused how&nbsp;to word my&nbsp;explanation of&nbsp;the numeral forms because I&nbsp;wasn’t sure if&nbsp;we can&nbsp;use all&nbsp;the same type anatomy terms since they don’t always apply to&nbsp;number forms. Certainly there are&nbsp;still counters and&nbsp;bars but&nbsp;do any&nbsp;numbers have a&nbsp;shoulder?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good question. I don’t know. I’m not really a type anatomy expert or super hung up on its nomenclature. I’ll bring my book on type anatomy in week 6, when you’ll be working on the poster for the type comparison. (If I forget, please ask; it’s in my office.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You should make sure the&nbsp;visual hierarchy matches the&nbsp;content&nbsp;hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You should use&nbsp;as many levels of&nbsp;heading as&nbsp;you need, and&nbsp;no more or&nbsp;less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Emphasis on <em>need</em>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have been trying to&nbsp;use GREP for&nbsp;cleaning up&nbsp;my book in&nbsp;book design but&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;bit confusing to&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sounds like you need to come to my <a href="https://calendly.com/bruno-ribeiro/office-hours" target="_blank">office hours</a> so I can help you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;start doing the&nbsp;RegexOne lessons closer to&nbsp;the day&nbsp;of the&nbsp;lab. I&nbsp;always do&nbsp;them early in&nbsp;the weekend but&nbsp;forget the&nbsp;GREP styles in&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can always go back to the lesson and redo, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m glad we’re going into GREP in-depth in&nbsp;this class, because it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;very handy for&nbsp;Book Design! My&nbsp;text has&nbsp;many typos :(.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please let me know if you need help with your files in Book Design. I’m happy to help and I’m on campus every day.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It took me&nbsp;a little bit&nbsp;to figure out&nbsp;what the&nbsp;intent was&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<code>\&lt;</code> and&nbsp;<code>\&gt;</code> indicators. I&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;overthink it, but&nbsp;you just put&nbsp;them at&nbsp;the beginning and&nbsp;end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Then you change only when the search matches the whole word. (Or the beginning/end of the word if you use only one of them.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week we&nbsp;learned more about GREP and&nbsp;practiced more techniques for&nbsp;finding specific words and&nbsp;changing the&nbsp;style of&nbsp;them with character styles. This will be&nbsp;very helpful for&nbsp;my book design class and&nbsp;finding certain words or&nbsp;phrases and&nbsp;changing the&nbsp;style of&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">By the way, you can do it directly on the paragraph style, so you don’t need to search for a word. For example, some typefaces need a different font for the lowercase numerals, so you can make on the paragraph style a GREP style to apply a specific character style to all digits.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I still really, really appreciate the&nbsp;emphasis you&nbsp;put on&nbsp;always making our&nbsp;websites accessible, thank you!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">And I, in turn, appreciate that GrC students embrace accessibility to their fullest.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I loved learning how&nbsp;Zuzana Licko designed bitmap typefaces at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her career much like how&nbsp;we started this class designing pixel&nbsp;fonts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m not sure if I knew that. By the way, all the designers for the next assignment are great, but Zuzana Licko and Susan Kare are two of my very favorite!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Thanks for&nbsp;coming and&nbsp;dinging the&nbsp;UGS bell, it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Oh, I’ll be sure to make you regret these words.</p>
