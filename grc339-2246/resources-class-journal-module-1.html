<h1>Class journal, module 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Since this class is&nbsp;virtual, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;with classmates in&nbsp;person or&nbsp;online to&nbsp;work through the&nbsp;labs&nbsp;together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s a great idea! I went ahead and made a <em>virtual collaboration</em> discussion on Canvas. You can post to each other there and see if anybody would like to team up for homework. Also, if you have any trouble publishing on GitHub or if you need any help with HTML/CSS, post screenshots there and you may get faster responses than by email. I’ll check it during normal business hours, but anyone can attempt to help too. Also, if you made a mistake, but figure it out later, do you mind sharing as a tip?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Taking classes while you&nbsp;are on&nbsp;vacation is&nbsp;a very easy way&nbsp;to forget about homework. Summer school was&nbsp;an interesting decision on&nbsp;my&nbsp;part.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You need a calendar. And alarms. And, hey!, good job remembering to submit your journal.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The CSS&nbsp;assignment was&nbsp;fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If that’s what you call fun, you’re my people.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Using my&nbsp;notes from 338&nbsp;was super&nbsp;helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good think that not only you took them, but you kept them. Good job!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;last question on&nbsp;the quiz, I&nbsp;believe you&nbsp;meant to&nbsp;put “in this order” instead of&nbsp;“his order” for&nbsp;two of&nbsp;the options. Just wanted to&nbsp;let you&nbsp;know!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">At this point, there have been hundreds of students who took that quiz and never said anything to me. Now, there’s candy with your name in my office. Please stop by my office in the fall.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Another student in&nbsp;this class reminded of&nbsp;the <code>@media</code> code that we&nbsp;were taught back in&nbsp;GrC 338, which was&nbsp;very helpful. Shoutout to&nbsp;Michael!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It wasn’t necessary for the assignment. But it helped.</p>

  <p>Here’s a&nbsp;resource that talks about what a&nbsp;flex property is: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-flex-property/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-flex-property/</a>.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Jasmine Sayed!</p>

  <p>Here’s a&nbsp;website I&nbsp;found that’s a&nbsp;guide to&nbsp;flexboxes: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/</a></p>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Kira!</p>

  <p>I found these extra resources from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">CSS&nbsp;Tricks</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox" target="_blank">MDN</a> helpful in&nbsp;further understanding&nbsp;flexbox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Alena! <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> are excellent resources for everything related to web development.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>You’ve always taught us&nbsp;to name the&nbsp;HTML file for&nbsp;our website homepages “index.html.” I’m curious if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;particular reason why, or&nbsp;is it&nbsp;more of&nbsp;a common naming&nbsp;convention?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It doesn’t work otherwise. From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32408259/why-do-people-name-their-files-index-html" target="_blank">this answer in StackOverflow</a>:  </p>

<blockquote class="insidejournal">
   <p>When you arrive a website, for example <code>www.website.com</code>, you're not pointing to a file (like you would be if you typed <code>www.website.com/about.html</code>), you're pointing to a directory listing of all the files. </p>

   <p>The webserver will try to serve a file, typically called <code>index.html</code> or <code>index.php</code> by default, but it could be something different, and it's configurable by editing your webserver's config files.  </p>

   <p>If the server doesn't find any file to serve (because you didn't include an index.html file or because you renamed it without editing the server's config) you will see a listing of the files, which is rarely the desired behavior, especially at the root of a website.</p>

</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You <em>could</em> configure your webserver to something else, although if it’s possible in GitHub. But I don’t think it’s worth it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>A topic that I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;investigate more is&nbsp;whether the&nbsp;sequence in&nbsp;which I&nbsp;write my&nbsp;CSS code influences how&nbsp;it’s displayed on&nbsp;the website. (Especially for&nbsp;the div.container).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It does. Let’s say you write <code>color: #f00;</code> and then <code>color: #00f;</code> for the same selector. Whatever comes last overrides what came first. With that said, though, more specific also overrides less specific even if they come first. I&nbsp;always <em>try</em> to write my CSS code from more generic to less specific to avoid different results in different browsers.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Flexbox seems more intuitive than grids. In&nbsp;338, I&nbsp;always struggled understanding how&nbsp;different properties would interact together to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;effective and&nbsp;responsive&nbsp;grid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I hear that a lot from students. I&nbsp;find CSS Grid much more straightforward, but a&nbsp;lot of students agree with you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When do&nbsp;we know where to&nbsp;use media queries or&nbsp;the flexbox properties on&nbsp;a website or&nbsp;project?</p>
</blockquote>


<p  class="classjournal">There’s no specific answer. I&nbsp;try to&nbsp;use media queries only when I have to. But I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;problem using them either. With time, you’ll learn what works best for&nbsp;you and&nbsp;your&nbsp;projects.</p>


<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Why are&nbsp;rows the&nbsp;default for&nbsp;flex containers and&nbsp;how do&nbsp;we change it&nbsp;into&nbsp;columns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Why? I&nbsp;don’t know. Probably because it’s the most common case. In the excelent <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a>, we can find <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">A Complete Guide to Flexbox</a>. In&nbsp;the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties" target="_blank">Flexbox properties</a>, I&nbsp;can see that the <code>flex-direction</code> property acceppst the <code>row</code>, <code>row-reverse</code>, <code>column</code> and <code>column-reverse</code> values. So if I&nbsp;want to change my flex container direction into columns, I&nbsp;write the declaration <code>flex-direction: column;</code>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;a little confused about what <code>flex-grow</code> is&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It tells the item that it should grow to take the available space beyond its initial size (defined by the <code>flex-basis</code> property).</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Flex-wrap wraps items if&nbsp;necessary” — Can&nbsp;you clarify when it&nbsp;is “necessary"? When the&nbsp;element extends beyond the&nbsp;viewport?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">If the elements extend beyond their containing element size. Let’s say the <code>flex-direction</code> is <code>row</code> (default). Then, if the sum of all flex items’ widths is wider than the flexbox width, then some of the items will move to the next lines. This is probably what you want.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;really interested in&nbsp;learning about flexbox, since it’s something that I’ve been trying to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;my webpages but&nbsp;never knew how&nbsp;to. Also, I&nbsp;appreciated the&nbsp;338 recap exam and&nbsp;review videos since it’s been a&nbsp;while since I&nbsp;took the&nbsp;course. I&nbsp;was surprised by&nbsp;how much I&nbsp;remembered, probably due&nbsp;to how&nbsp;we were pushed to&nbsp;actually think about how&nbsp;each concept is&nbsp;applied in&nbsp;experience. However, there were definitely a&nbsp;few blanks in&nbsp;my memory and&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like I’m much better prepared for&nbsp;this course thanks to&nbsp;the review exam. Thanks&nbsp;Bruno!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sometimes, it almost feels like I&nbsp;know what I’m&nbsp;doing.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m excited to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;my digital&nbsp;magazine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Oh, thanks for reminding me. The <a href="https://grc-ribeiro.github.io/grc339-2246/assignments-digital-magazine-proposal.html" target="_blank">proposal</a> is not due for a few weeks (module&nbsp;7), but you may want to go ahead and start thinking about it.</p>
