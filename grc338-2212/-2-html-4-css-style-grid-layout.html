##### [GRC 338](index.html): [Assignments](assignments.html)



CSS style: grid layout  
=============================


Using the files from the last assignments, use CSS Grid and media queries **as necessary** to make the page adapt to different sizes. If you need media queries, make sure that your media queries have a minimum width (i.e. `min-width: XXem`).

Tasks  
-----------

1. Start by reading my comments from the last assignment. Make sure to address every issue on it.

1. Copy your files from last week into a new folder.

1. Sketch your layouts with pen and paper.

1. Include on the media query only what’s absolute necessary. (i.e.: only what’s different on wider screens.)

1. [Check the list of mistakes to avoid.][mistakes]

1. Keep your CSS organized. 

**Don’t forget:** You&nbsp;want to&nbsp;**work offline**, saving your files on&nbsp;your computer. Only when you’re happy with the&nbsp;results that you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;upload to&nbsp;GitHub. You&nbsp;may change your mind and&nbsp;upload a&nbsp;new file, but&nbsp;what you&nbsp;don’t want is&nbsp;to work straight on&nbsp;GitHub.

Whatever you do, though, you may not edit the HTML file at all.

Publish your pages on the URL: **_username_.github.io/grc338/css-responsive-grid**

Requirements  
------------------

1. You’re not required to use all the properties we’ve covered. Use as many or as few as you find appropriate.

1. I may have overdone it with divs and classes. Don’t feel like you need to style every single class I used in my HTML file. You may choose to ignore some of them if you think it’s the most appropriate.

1. Have I mentioned that you are not allowed to change the HTML file?

Evaluation  
----------------

I’ll be&nbsp;assessing your ability to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;solution that is&nbsp;visually interesting and&nbsp;appropriate for&nbsp;the content, but&nbsp;you’ll be&nbsp;mostly evaluated on&nbsp;your technical skills using&nbsp;CSS.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Tips  
-----------

1. If you want to **center your page on the window**, give the `div.container` the properties `max-width: XXem;` and `margin: auto;`, replacing `XXem` with any value you want, probably somewhere between `30em` and `80em`.

1. You may use [Google Fonts][] and [Adobe Fonts][], but you have to use the [`@import ` link][import] directly in your CSS file, because, you know, you can’t change the HTML file!

1. **Do not change the HTML file for any reason! Not one bit!!!**

1. Always make sure to [avoid the most common mistakes][mistakes]

Hint  
----------

1. I suggest that you upload the old HTML, CSS, and JPEG files to the new folder in GitHub before you even start changing anything.

1. Then you check [your name][]. It'll be the last week's layout, of course.

1. When you're done working with your new CSS, you use it to replace the old one.

This will prevent you from emailing me on Monday night saying that your file is not working.

Submission  
---------------

1. You don’t have to submit anything on Canvas.

1. Got to your public repository on GitHub, and open a new folder named **grc338/css-responsive-grid/**.&nbsp;[➤][ght]

1. Create a new **index.html** file and commit.&nbsp;[➤][ght]

1. Upload all three files (*index.html*, *lasagnastyle.css*, and *lasagna.jpg*) to your GitHub repository.&nbsp;[➤][ght]

1. Click on [your name][] to check if it’s working.

**Due Monday, 8&nbsp;February&nbsp;2021, at&nbsp;11:59 pm.**
