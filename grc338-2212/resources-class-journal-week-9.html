<h1>Class journal, week 9  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Although it’s nice to&nbsp;not have as&nbsp;many assignments due&nbsp;while final projects are&nbsp;due for&nbsp;other classes, I&nbsp;do miss seeing everyone’s design examples through your&nbsp;recaps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I do miss them too, but I’ve figured a few years ago that students can really benefit from slower final weeks after an intense quarter. Who knew?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This class was&nbsp;really helpful and&nbsp;I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;was the&nbsp;first time that I&nbsp;actually felt like I&nbsp;understood HTML and&nbsp;CSS. Thank&nbsp;you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thank you!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I still find myself going back and&nbsp;re-watching old&nbsp;lessons to&nbsp;refresh my&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">They’ll always be there. I mean, always might be a very long time, but let’s say I have no plans to take them down soon.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I didn’t score as&nbsp;great as&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would on&nbsp;the CMS&nbsp;proposal, was&nbsp;it missing content or&nbsp;containing&nbsp;errors? How many scores are dropped again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please check the rubric and read the comments. No scores are dropped for this assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;really fun&nbsp;creating website content for&nbsp;a fictional&nbsp;business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s fun to see them too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also think I&nbsp;was too&nbsp;ambitious on&nbsp;the Mobile First assignment, so&nbsp;going back and&nbsp;simplifying it&nbsp;made me&nbsp;realize that simplicity is&nbsp;key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Especially on mobile. That’s why we do mobile first.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;super excited to&nbsp;mess around more with Squarespace because I&nbsp;currently have a&nbsp;client who&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;now revamp her&nbsp;website and&nbsp;I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;help her! We&nbsp;already collaborated on&nbsp;designs so&nbsp;once I&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;how to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;website builder, the&nbsp;process should be&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;streamlined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes! Help her with her website using a tool that makes it easier for her to update later.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I find it&nbsp;really interesting to&nbsp;see what everyone else in&nbsp;the class is&nbsp;making for&nbsp;their projects; I&nbsp;often click on&nbsp;everyone’s&nbsp;links!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I would too!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;noticing how&nbsp;much I&nbsp;actually dislike most websites and&nbsp;am getting picky about web&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s the curse of studying design. Sorry, not sorry.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week in&nbsp;class we&nbsp;had the&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with our&nbsp;own concept for&nbsp;a website and&nbsp;write the&nbsp;HTML code from scratch. I&nbsp;found it&nbsp;very helpful via&nbsp;the proposal template to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;similar websites beforehand for&nbsp;inspiration. Now&nbsp;when I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;style my&nbsp;website with CSS&nbsp;in the&nbsp;coming week, I&nbsp;will know what the&nbsp;final product should look similar&nbsp;to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That was the idea!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I often forget about the&nbsp;coding elements after each class that I&nbsp;take. What would you&nbsp;recommend doing to&nbsp;retain the&nbsp;information and&nbsp;continuously be&nbsp;working with CSS/HTML?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Just keep working. Make websites for fun. Get a <strong>paid</strong> internship… Or you can take GRC 339 to improve.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Looking at&nbsp;each website example for&nbsp;my proposal, I&nbsp;realized how&nbsp;complex a&nbsp;digital storefront is&nbsp;and how&nbsp;hard that would be&nbsp;to code in&nbsp;HTML. It&nbsp;makes sense that using websites templates is&nbsp;common.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, if you need e-commerce, then you really need a template. Or a team of engineers.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>When designing a&nbsp;website, center-aligned text such as&nbsp;paragraphs is&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;read than left-aligned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not only on websites.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I like how&nbsp;you always remind us&nbsp;of the&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;alt text for&nbsp;our&nbsp;images!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not only is it the right thing to do, it’s the law.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;final exam, will it&nbsp;be similar to&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;the&nbsp;midterm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s on design principles, not HTML/CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m also excited to&nbsp;compare having built a&nbsp;website from HTML/CSS to&nbsp;a website builder like&nbsp;Squarespace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You may miss the simplicity of HTML/CSS sometimes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For small businesses such as&nbsp;cafes or&nbsp;barbershops, you&nbsp;don’t need that level of&nbsp;control of&nbsp;coding the&nbsp;website so&nbsp;you can&nbsp;use website builders instead. A&nbsp;web designer can&nbsp;help customers set&nbsp;up their website and&nbsp;teach them how&nbsp;to do&nbsp;maintenance after&nbsp;that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Like I said, several of my students have made some money doing exactly that.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What I’ve learned in&nbsp;this class helped me&nbsp;understand Adobe Portfolio recently because their site builder organizes page elements using containers and&nbsp;semantic HTML elements like headers and&nbsp;footers. You&nbsp;can customize the&nbsp;max-width of&nbsp;containers along with other adjustments that we’ve learned how&nbsp;to do&nbsp;with&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s why it’s still very much relevant to learn to code by hand. That’s how you understand it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Would you&nbsp;recommend starting a&nbsp;website portfolio through Squarespace? Or&nbsp;what other options are&nbsp;there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Some students like Wix. But Behance is also a good solution, although less customizable.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned how&nbsp;to play the&nbsp;card game “Egyptian War” and&nbsp;I’m not&nbsp;too bad&nbsp;at&nbsp;it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Never heard of it. But I like playing cards.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned in&nbsp;another class that the&nbsp;recycle arrows and&nbsp;numbers on&nbsp;packaging don’t really have anything to&nbsp;do with recyclability, which was&nbsp;quite disappointing as&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been misled : (</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">What? What <em>do</em> they mean, then?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I thoroughly enjoyed each HTML/CSS assignment each week. I&nbsp;was quite worried in&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;this class because coding classes were definitely not&nbsp;my favorite. However, the&nbsp;structure of&nbsp;this class made learning much easier (especially in&nbsp;an online format). Thanks Bruno for&nbsp;making this class engaging and&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;follow :-)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thank you!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Since this is&nbsp;the last journal submission, I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;say that I&nbsp;really enjoyed this class and&nbsp;I&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;further my&nbsp;knowledge of&nbsp;HTML and&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks! Don’t forget to write your evaluations!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This has&nbsp;been the&nbsp;longest and&nbsp;shortest quarter…bummed this class is&nbsp;over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I see you in GRC 339?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Here is&nbsp;a simple but&nbsp;entertaining joke: <br />
    Why did the golfer bring two pairs of pants? <br />
    In case he gets a hole in one. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    (Joke submitted by Jason Reinwald)</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Week 9 and we finally get a joke submission. Thanks, Jason!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The quarter is&nbsp;almost over! Glad to&nbsp;have made it&nbsp;to this point and&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;have learned things in&nbsp;this class that I&nbsp;will think about for&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks! I too learned from you all and will take valuable lessons with me.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week I&nbsp;learned…. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    To&nbsp;be cautious of&nbsp;your surroundings <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    That being nice to&nbsp;people pays off! <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    Take risks, but&nbsp;not too&nbsp;many <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    and&nbsp; <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    Stay healthy at&nbsp;all costs! <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
    Don’t lose faith in&nbsp;yourself!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Cheers!</p>

<hr />

<p  class="classjournal"><strong>New links on&nbsp;the class website.</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thanks to Von Garcia Balanon again!</p>
