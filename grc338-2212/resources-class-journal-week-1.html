<h1>Class journal, week 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m not&nbsp;exactly excited to&nbsp;be back in&nbsp;a coding-based course, but&nbsp;thus far&nbsp;my expectations have been exceeded&nbsp;greatly!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let’s talk again in week 9. You may be surprised by how this class goes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned the&nbsp;structure of&nbsp;the class and&nbsp;got an&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;what I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;do each&nbsp;day!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Class will be very consistent.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I liked the&nbsp;video you&nbsp;made summarizing the&nbsp;design principles, especially explaining the&nbsp;examples and&nbsp;providing feedback; it&nbsp;was good&nbsp;review.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I plan to post one every Friday. And I expect everybody to watch them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I enjoyed your review of&nbsp;our examples. It&nbsp;was very enlightening in&nbsp;many ways. Personally, I&nbsp;learned more about the&nbsp;Aesthetic Usability Effect by&nbsp;watching the&nbsp;video and&nbsp;comparing our&nbsp;examples to&nbsp;others. I&nbsp;found the&nbsp;Crispy Carrie chocolate bar&nbsp;example incredibly informative as&nbsp;to a&nbsp;more accurate example of&nbsp;the Aesthetic Usability&nbsp;Effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It was a good example, indeed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned checking examples with you&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;submitting is&nbsp;a smart move (saved my&nbsp;team some deductions, for&nbsp;sure).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Smart (and easy) move, indeed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The first time I&nbsp;copy/pasted the&nbsp;code into the&nbsp;index, I&nbsp;didn’t copy it&nbsp;correctly or&nbsp;missed something, so&nbsp;the code wasn’t working which was&nbsp;really frustrating. When I&nbsp;redid the&nbsp;step though, it&nbsp;worked… must have missed an&nbsp;extra space or&nbsp;something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m glad it worked after a second try. In the future, if it doesn’t work after a few tries, you can ask for a colleague to look at it, or you can send me an email with screenshots too, of course.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Group discussion wasn’t difficult. I&nbsp;found that linking a&nbsp;google doc&nbsp;is helpful so&nbsp;that everyone can&nbsp;contribute and/or work on&nbsp;it at&nbsp;the same&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Any group can use whatever tool you agree upon. Google doc is a great option that mixes some of synchronous and some of asynchronous in the right amount.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really appreciated you&nbsp;taking the&nbsp;time to&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;our discussion; this made the&nbsp;assignment more&nbsp;clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Any time you need my help with anything, just let me know. You just have to work ahead of the deadline.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The examples I&nbsp;saw listed for&nbsp;the design principles discussion were all&nbsp;super interesting. Rarely do&nbsp;I&nbsp;ever take the&nbsp;time to&nbsp;read through a&nbsp;whole discussion, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt encouraged to&nbsp;do so&nbsp;in this&nbsp;group!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Good to know! I found the examples really good overall.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Failure is&nbsp;GOOD. It’s an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;learn and&nbsp;improve a&nbsp;product or&nbsp;process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Failure is only a real failure when you don’t learn anything from it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Eventually, I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;explore techniques for&nbsp;maximizing the&nbsp;ease-of-use and&nbsp;perceived friendliness of&nbsp;our&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">We’ll cover it in this class, but it’s also covered in GRC&nbsp;339 and&nbsp;GRC&nbsp;429.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>In watching the&nbsp;video, I&nbsp;also learned that the&nbsp;focus of&nbsp;this class will be&nbsp;on the&nbsp;user, rather than on&nbsp;a consumer. I&nbsp;like this focus because it&nbsp;will hopefully allow us&nbsp;to concentrate on&nbsp;the actual quality of&nbsp;our work, rather than trying to&nbsp;market it&nbsp;or&nbsp;whatnot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You got it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned that wireframes are&nbsp;detailed, extremely early stage&nbsp;prototypes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s how I use the word “wireframe” at least. Others use them differently, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Are there specific elements (ie- color, photos) that are&nbsp;universally applied in&nbsp;web design to&nbsp;increase the&nbsp;aesthetic usability&nbsp;effect?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Nope. But blank space and consistent alignment help a lot.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I didn’t know there were many variations to&nbsp;prototyping. Prototyping means the&nbsp;creation of&nbsp;a simple design or&nbsp;idea. I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea that there were different types of&nbsp;prototyping including concept prototyping, throwaway prototyping, evolutionary prototyping and&nbsp;incorporate&nbsp;prototyping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">More important than knowing their classifications it to understand that you want to build the prototype for what you need to learn.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I still sometimes have a&nbsp;hard time distinguishing between the&nbsp;3 basic structures of&nbsp;hierarchy because some examples appear that they can&nbsp;be more than 1&nbsp;basic structure. Is&nbsp;it possible for&nbsp;hierarchy to&nbsp;be represented with more than one&nbsp;structure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. Absolutely.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;assigned to&nbsp;provide examples for&nbsp;the aesthetic-usability effect this week, which was&nbsp;really interesting for&nbsp;me because it&nbsp;put something into words that I&nbsp;had already formed an&nbsp;abstract understanding of&nbsp;in my&nbsp;mind. Basically, learning more about this effect helped to&nbsp;affirm some of&nbsp;the instincts that I’ve been feeling for&nbsp;a while&nbsp;now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’ll notice it more times in the next week, that instinctively you knew most of those principles to be true, but you didn’t know their names. Knowing their names and having discussing them you help you make more intentional decisions in the future. <strong>To design it to make decisions.</strong></p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One thing I’m still a&nbsp;bit confused with is&nbsp;the relationship between prototyping and&nbsp;iterating. Is&nbsp;it correct to&nbsp;say that a&nbsp;prototyping cycle before a&nbsp;final release is&nbsp;“iterative prototyping”?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I can’t see why not.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What defines a&nbsp;complex hierarchy, how&nbsp;much is&nbsp;too much for&nbsp;a tree&nbsp;structure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There’s no hard rule. You have to figure it out on your own or (ideally) through usability tests with real users.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>While reading I&nbsp;understood the&nbsp;distinction between the&nbsp;three types of&nbsp;hierarchy when reading. However, I&nbsp;couldn’t identify what type of&nbsp;hierarchy it&nbsp;was when I&nbsp;was looking for&nbsp;examples for&nbsp;the group assignment. Similarly, the&nbsp;rest of&nbsp;the group found the&nbsp;distinction between the&nbsp;tree, nested, and&nbsp;stair hierarchy to&nbsp;be difficult when they go&nbsp;one-deep in&nbsp;levels. Layla, one&nbsp;of my&nbsp;group members, shared an&nbsp;article that helped cleared our&nbsp;confusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve included the article in the readings. (Thanks for sharing, Layla!) But don’t worry about the distinction between different hierarchy representations. Just keep in mind that you have to aim at having the best visual representation for the content hierarchy.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Something this week that stood out&nbsp;to me&nbsp;was the&nbsp;article, “Why is&nbsp;so much design school a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;time?” This was&nbsp;really encouraging for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;read. I&nbsp;always forget that as&nbsp;a creative designer, I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;gold miner, not&nbsp;a customer. Being a&nbsp;good listener isn’t needed in&nbsp;just your close relationships but&nbsp;in every aspect of&nbsp;life. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;designing and&nbsp;working with clients, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;become skilled in&nbsp;listening for&nbsp;that 10% of&nbsp;important&nbsp;information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It is a great article. When Professor Cezzar first shared it on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrRib/status/667870623356456960" target="_blank">I&nbsp;promised her</a> I’d assign it to all my future classes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>On my&nbsp;own did&nbsp;some relearning of&nbsp;some HTML on&nbsp;LinkedIn&nbsp;Learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s cool! They tend to be super helpful and well done.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I finally remembered the&nbsp;shortcut to&nbsp;a Mac&nbsp;Screenshot and&nbsp;the proper capture&nbsp;techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I beg everybody to follow them. I put a lot of effort to make my lectures/videos well presented. I need good images to go in them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I read through the&nbsp;instructions for&nbsp;submitting work on&nbsp;GitHub for&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the quarter which was&nbsp;confusing, but&nbsp;I’m hoping that doing the&nbsp;actual process will clear things&nbsp;up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Like everything else in this class, GitHub is simpler than it first seems. But if you need my help, I’m here to help everybody succeed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>My understanding from this week is&nbsp;that there is&nbsp;a compromise in&nbsp;designing, where everything initially intended in&nbsp;the concept may&nbsp;not be&nbsp;included for&nbsp;sake of&nbsp;overall functionality and&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">To design it to make decisions.</p>
