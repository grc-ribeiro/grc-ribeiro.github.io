<p  class="classjournal">€€ 22 Design principles ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>From the&nbsp;mobile first assignment, I&nbsp;learned that text should be&nbsp;aligned with your&nbsp;pictures.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ From the Alignment principle: “Elements in a design should be aligned with one or more other elements. This creates a sense of unity and cohesion, which contributes to the design’s overall aesthetic and perceived stability. ”</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 90 General ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>I was&nbsp;really nervous to&nbsp;style the&nbsp;mobile first assignment, but&nbsp;after getting feedback, it&nbsp;seems like I&nbsp;didn’t do&nbsp;too bad! I’m excited to&nbsp;improve it&nbsp;for the&nbsp;next&nbsp;assignment.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ I look forward to seeing it!</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 02 Office hours ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>I have finally gotten the&nbsp;hang of&nbsp;grids and&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel more comfortable incorporating it&nbsp;into my&nbsp;designs. However, I&nbsp;still need more practice and&nbsp;the labs help me&nbsp;with&nbsp;that!</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ If you need any help, [let me know][oh]. </p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 34 CSS ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>In the&nbsp;CSS Responsive video, it&nbsp;showed media queries used with “min-width”. Is&nbsp;it possible to&nbsp;use media queries for&nbsp;“max-width"?</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Yes. And many people do. That’s how it used to be done. But then, we realize that the most sensible is to design for mobile first and then adapt to wider screens as necessary.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 22 Design principles ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>My group was&nbsp;assigned to&nbsp;errors. I&nbsp;really enjoyed reading about the&nbsp;different examples of&nbsp;how we&nbsp;forgive these slips. For&nbsp;example, one&nbsp;of my&nbsp;group mates posted about deleting your phone number on&nbsp;your Amazon account. Before deleting it, Amazon asks the&nbsp;user if&nbsp;they are&nbsp;sure about deleting their phone number. I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;notice that many websites do&nbsp;similar confirmation screens to&nbsp;prevent slips that cause permanent changes to&nbsp;your account. For&nbsp;example, Pinterest asks for&nbsp;confirmation if&nbsp;you try&nbsp;to delete a&nbsp;Pinterest&nbsp;board.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ I just wish they kept the old versions for a week or so, allowing for reversibility. Instead of trying to avoid errors, allow for reversibility.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 04 Video lectures ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>Although I&nbsp;understand how&nbsp;the responsive grid works, I&nbsp;am still a&nbsp;little confused on&nbsp;how everything works… will have to&nbsp;go back and&nbsp;watch the&nbsp;video a&nbsp;couple more&nbsp;times.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ They’ll be there for you. But if you need any help, please [let me know][oh].</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 34 CSS ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>I need to&nbsp;be more thorough when I&nbsp;check the&nbsp;mistakes list. I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;had everything, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;missed something small which cost me&nbsp;points :(</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Please do! And don’t worry too much about the points. They will help you not to make the same mistakes again.×</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 99 Closing ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>It’s really helpful to&nbsp;study outside! Having fresh air&nbsp;and sunshine makes zoom fatigue feel a&nbsp;little bit&nbsp;better.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Great tip! I like being outside too.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 34 CSS ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>I added an&nbsp;HTML plugin to&nbsp;Squarespace and&nbsp;they used <code>rem</code>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;unit of&nbsp;measurement. Is&nbsp;that just the&nbsp;same as&nbsp;<code>em</code>?</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Great question! <code>rem</code> and <code>em</code> are not exactly the same, but close. “rem” stands for “root em”. So that means that <code>1rem</code> is font size of the <code>html</code> element. In most browsers, it’s <code>16px</code>, but the reason we use <code>em</code> instead of <code>px</code> for everything is to adapt to different preferences, in case someone chooses their browser to be bigger or smaller. By default, paragraphs are <code>1em</code> and I ask you to keep them to respect the user’s preference. But let’s say you styled your <code>h2</code> as <code>2.5em</code>, which is reasonable. Then, if you give both <code>p</code> and <code>h2</code> a <code>margin-left: 1.25em</code>, you would expect them to be aligned to the left, but shifted to the right. Well, that won’t happen. <code>p</code> will move to <code>1.25em</code> to the right, but <code>h2</code> will move <code>3.125em</code> to the right, because <em>its</em> <code>em</code> is worth <code>2.5×</code> the original <code>em</code>. So instead, you want to apply <code>margin-left: 1.25rem</code> to both <code>p</code> and <code>h2</code> so they are always aligned. In the end, <code>rem</code> is a unit that’s easier to use than <code>em</code>, and you’re welcome to use it if it makes sense to you.</p>
