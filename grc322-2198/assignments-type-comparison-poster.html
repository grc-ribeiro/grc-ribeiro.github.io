<h1>Type comparison  </h1>

<h2>Poster  </h2>

<p>After working on your research and presentation, choose what graphics were more effective when you taught us the differences and similarities between the two typefaces you worked on.</p>

<p>Design a 24&Prime;&times;36&Prime; poster that informs about those differences and similarities. Include some facts and a brief history of the typeface, but&nbsp;emphasize similarities and&nbsp;differences.</p>

<p>Make sure to pay attention to  all the details on typography that we have covered in this class and you have learned in GRC 318, including:</p>

<p>Typeface selection, leading, line length, kerning, tracking, grid, baseline grid, type anatomy, type classification, type hierarchy, indentation, hyphenation, ragged lines, widows, orphans, proper punctuation characters, old-style figures</p>

<p><strong>Check your spelling eight times at least.</strong> Then have one or twelve other people checking it for you.</p>
