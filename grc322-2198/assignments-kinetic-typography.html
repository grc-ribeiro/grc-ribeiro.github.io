<h1>Kinetic typography  </h1>

<p>This assignment will be consisted of making a video for the opening sequence of a movie. The hypothetical movie needs to be based on a fiction book of your choice, as long as it hasn&rsquo;t been featured on screens. Your video must be between 30 and 90 seconds. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest using the same book you used for the movie poster assignment, but it&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>

<h2>Constraints  </h2>

<p>You may use type, motion, shapes, colors, sounds, music, voice, live video, or any element to set the tone for your hypothetical movie. <strong>Emphasis on type in motion.</strong></p>

<p>You may use copyright&#8209;free, live action footage or vector, 2D illustration. But this is not an animation course; if you&rsquo;re using illustration, don&rsquo;t try to make it realistic. Make it graphical, instead.</p>

<p>Music is required and sound effects are strongly advised.</p>

<p>(You are encouraged to have fun with the assignment, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you want it to be funny. Avoid jokes, puns, etc.)  </p>
