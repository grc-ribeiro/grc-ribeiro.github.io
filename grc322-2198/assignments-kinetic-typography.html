<h1>Kinetic typography  </h1>

<p>This is a group assignment will be consisted of making a 90&#8209;to&#8209;120&#8209;second, informational, and&nbsp;educational movie.</p>

<p>The theme is open, but must be relevant to your audience. The broader the audience, the better.</p>

<p>The narrative must be based on facts, not opinions; and quantitative data, rather than qualitative data.</p>

<h2>Constraints  </h2>

<p>You may use type, motion, shapes, colors, sounds, music, voice, live video, or any element to tell the story. <strong>Emphasis on type in motion.</strong></p>

<p>You may use copyright&#8209;free, live action footage or vector, 2D illustration. This is not an animation course. If you&amp;rsquo;re using illustration, don&amp;rsquo;t try to make it realistic. Make it graphical, instead.</p>

<p>Music is required and sound effects are strongly advised.</p>

<p>(You are encouraged to have fun with the assignment, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you want it to be funny. Avoid jokes, puns, etc.)  </p>

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<p>You will be evaluated on the quality of your story, visual language, motion effects, and sound.</p>

<hr id="References-page" />

<h2>References page
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, each <strong>group</strong> needs to present their references for the project. I recommend using a board on Pinterest with 30 to 70 images and videos. (Make sure you have an exclusive board for the project.)</p>

<p>The refererence page counts for 10% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a link to your references until <strong>Friday,&nbsp;8&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:59pm</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Stills" />

<h2>Stills
  </h2>

<p>Using any software of your choice, design high&#8209;definition, still images of two or three frames of your video, to show the visual language. (Two&nbsp;or three screens <strong>per student</strong>.)</p>

<p>Stills count for 10% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p>Individual submissions to <strong>PolyLearn</strong>: Submit a multi&#8209;page PDF until <strong>Friday, 15&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;1:10pm</strong>, using the name convention <strong><em>lastname&#8209;stills.pdf</em></strong>.</p>

<hr id="Script" />

<h2>Script
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, each group should write a <strong>detailed script</strong> of their movie. Include all the text (on screen and narration), description of the images, and estimated timeframe. (You can find examples from previous years on PolyLearn.) </p>

<p>The script counts for 10% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p>Individual submissions to <strong>PolyLearn</strong>: Submit a multi&#8209;page PDF until <strong>Monday, 18&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;1:10pm</strong>, using the name convention <strong><em>lastname&#8209;script.pdf</em></strong>.</p>

<hr id="First-draft" />

<h2>First draft
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, a <em>first draft</em> of your project is due on <strong>November&nbsp;18th</strong>. This draft should consist of a series of videos (one movie per student), with iconography, colors, and typography as intended as final. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, however, if it lacks <em>any</em> motion. You may think of it as a <em>playable slideshow</em>, or roughly one frame every two or three seconds, as needed. Also, all choices made to this point are open to discussion before final submission. </p>

<p>The first draft counts for 15% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Individual submissions</strong> to <strong>PolyLearn</strong>: Submit a link to your video on <em>Vimeo</em> or <em>YouTube</em> until <strong>Monday,&nbsp;18&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019, at 1:10pm</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Second-draft" />

<h2>Second draft
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, a <em>second draft</em> of your project is due on <strong>December&nbsp;2nd</strong>. This draft should consist of a full&#8209;length video, with iconography, colors, typography, and motion as intended as final. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, however, if it lacks refinement and secondary animation. Also, all choices made to this point are open to discussion, of course.</p>

<p>The second draft counts for 25% of your grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Group submissions</strong> to <strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a link to your video on <em>Vimeo</em> or <em>YouTube</em> until <strong>Monday, 2&nbsp;December, at&nbsp;1:10pm</strong>.</p>

<p>The final deliverable is a 90&#8209;to&#8209;120&#8209;second movie, with 1920&amp;times;1080, 30 fps, produced in Adobe After Effects.</p>

<p>The final deliverable counts for 30% of your grade for this assignment.</p>
