<h1>Kinetic typography  </h1>

<p>This assignment will be consisted of making a video for the opening sequence of a movie. The hypothetical movie needs to be based on a fiction book of your choice, as long as it hasn&rsquo;t been featured on screens. Your video must be between 30 and 90 seconds. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest using the same book you used for the movie poster assignment, but it&rsquo;s not a requirement.</p>

<p>The final deliverable is a 30&ndash;90 second movie, 1280&times;720 pixels or 1920&times;1080 pixels, 30 fps, produced in Adobe After Effects or another software.</p>

<h2>Constraints  </h2>

<p>You may use type, motion, shapes, colors, sounds, music, voice, live video, or any element to set the tone for your hypothetical movie. <strong>Emphasis on type in motion.</strong></p>

<p>You may use copyright&#8209;free, live action footage or vector, 2D illustration. But this is not an animation course; if you&rsquo;re using illustration, don&rsquo;t try to make it realistic. Make it graphical, instead.</p>

<p>Music is required and sound effects are strongly advised.</p>

<p>(You are encouraged to have fun with the assignment, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you want it to be funny. Avoid jokes, puns, etc.)  </p>

<hr id="Storyboard" />

<h2>Storyboard
  </h2>

<p>As part of the process, you must produce a <strong>storyboard</strong> with 20 to 40 panels. The storyboard can be done digitally or through sketches. Its purpose is to convey the story of the video, not its visual language. </p>

<p>No submission or grade.</p>

<hr id="Stills" />

<h2>Stills
  </h2>

<p>Using any software of your choice, design high&#8209;definition, still images of two or three frames of your video, to show the visual language. </p>

<p>No submission or grade.</p>

<hr id="First-draft" />

<h2>First draft
  </h2>

<p><strong>Full length</strong> of your final piece (30&ndash;90 seconds). You should include one slide every 5 or 10 seconds, as needed.</p>

<p>Include <strong>all the content</strong> that will be displayed as <strong>text on screen</strong>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using <strong>video footage</strong>, you may use still photographs as placeholders. (But I do encourage you to find the right footage sooner rather than later.)</p>

<p>Include some <strong>music</strong> too. (Nothing is set in stone at this point, but having <em>a</em> song there as a placeholder helps communicating the mood you&rsquo;re aiming for.)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about <strong>sound effects</strong> yet, unless they&rsquo;re an essencial part of your communication.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about <strong>transitions</strong>. This deliverable is more like a playable storyboard than a video.</p>

<p>This deliverable has two main goals: discuss the visual language and analyze the flow for the whole video. It&rsquo;s a holistic view so we can have discussions about each part of work without ever losing perspective of the whole.</p>

<p>Your first draft counts for 15% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a link to your video on <em>Vimeo</em> or <em>YouTube</em> until <strong>Thursday, 14&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:55&nbsp;pm</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Second-draft" />

<h2>Second draft
  </h2>

<p>The second draft is an improved version of the playable slideshow. Refine your visual language, improve the flow, and show hints on transitions. Sound effects are not strictly necessary, but you should show some hints on how they will work on the final piece.</p>

<p>Your second draft counts for 15% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<hr id="Final-critique" />

<h2>Final critique
  </h2>

<p>Full&#8209;length movie, with iconography, colors, typography, motion, footage, and music as intended as final. All choices made to this point are open to discussion before final submission. </p>

<p>The interim critique counts for 30% of the grade on this assignment.</p>

<p><strong>PolyLearn:</strong> Submit a link to your video on <em>Vimeo</em> or <em>YouTube</em> until <strong>Tuesday, 3&nbsp;December&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;11:55&nbsp;pm</strong>.</p>

<hr id="Final-submission" />

<h2>Final submission
  </h2>

<p>Based on the final critique, make the necessary reviews on your video. </p>

<p>The final submission counts for 40% of your grade for this assignment. (If you don&rsquo;t submit a link on PolyLearn, the grade from the final critique will be repeated.)</p>
