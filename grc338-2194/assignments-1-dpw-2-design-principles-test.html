<h1>Design principles examples test 2  </h1>

<p>Read about the principles of design from the <em>Universal principles of design</em> book. </p>

<p>Find <strong>at least two images</strong> that will represent each of the two principles <strong>assigned to you</strong> (find your name below). </p>

<p>One image should be of a physical product and the other should show a website. </p>

<p>Write <strong>one paragraph for each image</strong>, explaining why it is an example <strong>good design</strong> and <strong>good use</strong> of the principle. Use the theory of the book as well as your own words.  Submit your paragraph descriptions as online text on PolyLearn. Do not write your name, the name of the principle, date, or anything. <strong>Write two and only two paragraphs per submission:</strong> in the first paragraph, you write about the physical example; in the second paragraph, you write about the website example.</p>

<p>Each image should be <strong>1200px wide, at least</strong>. </p>

<p>Your images must be <strong>PNG files</strong>. If you downloaded them in any other format, open them in Photoshop (or another program) and save them as <code>.png</code>. If you just change the extension rather than resaving or exporting the files, it won&rsquo;t be a true PNG file, and a penalty will be applied to your grade.</p>

<p>Read these tips on how to <a href="resources-how-to-take-good-screenshots-of-webpages-on-a-mac.html">take a good screenshot on a Mac</a>. </p>

<p>Submit two <strong>PNG files</strong> to PolyLearn: </p>

<p><strong><em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-1.png</em></strong> (Physical example) <br />
<strong><em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-2.png</em></strong> (Web design example)  </p>

<p>Use all lowercase and replace the spaces on the name with hyphens (<code>-</code>), <em>not underscores</em>.</p>

<p>(If you want to submit more than one image, just add lowercase letters after the numbers: <em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-1a.png</em>, <em>lastname-name-of-the-principle-1b.png</em>, etc., but keep the physical examples as #1 and web design examples as #2.)</p>

<p>No example designed by Apple, Google, or Netflix allowed.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="resources-design-principle-examples.html">two examples of submissions</a>, so you can have a better idea on how to write your paragraphs and how to name your image files.</p>

<p>You will present your images in class. It&rsquo;s a very informal presentation, from your own seat, but you are expected to explain the principle assigned to you, using the images as examples.</p>

<p><strong>This is not a group assignment.</strong> Each student is required to submit a set with a physical example and a website example for each of the principle assigned to them. (Each student is assign)  </p>

<h3>Always due on the Sunday before your presentation at 11:55pm.</h3>

<h4>You are required to <strong>meet with me during the week prior your deadline</strong> to discuss your examples before submitting your assignment. You may discuss your examples during office hours or&nbsp;during the lab.</h4>
