<h1>Class journal, module 4  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>After reading last week’s journals from my&nbsp;peers, I&nbsp;saw someone wrote that they missed an&nbsp;assignment that didn’t show on&nbsp;the mobile dashboard. Now, I’ve been checking the&nbsp;modules for&nbsp;all of&nbsp;my classes more closely and&nbsp;it has&nbsp;saved me&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;missing assignments. Overall, these journals are&nbsp;helpful!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please keep read them!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Are there multiple right answers to&nbsp;these Flexbox assignments or&nbsp;are you&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;specific&nbsp;numbers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There are some different right answers for each property.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I did&nbsp;find all&nbsp;the different sections a&nbsp;bit more confusing than last week, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;keep rewatching the&nbsp;videos to&nbsp;remember what to&nbsp;do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s expected.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Where would the&nbsp;data collected by&nbsp;this webpage go? How&nbsp;is it&nbsp;stored?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You’ll need some backend development there. It’s not too complicated, but it’d required structure that we don’t have and skills that wouldn’t be relevant to a GrC student.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It was&nbsp;great being back in&nbsp;the in-person lab! (I had&nbsp;covid 2&nbsp;weeks ago&nbsp;and last week lab&nbsp;was canceled/online) and&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt much more engaged and&nbsp;motivated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let’s hope for more normal labs from now on. It’ll be helpful on the magazine project.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>There is, unfortunately, no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;push to&nbsp;two different accounts at&nbsp;the same time on&nbsp;GitHub Desktop without logging out&nbsp;of one&nbsp;and logging into the&nbsp;other. Not&nbsp;a big&nbsp;deal for&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;found a&nbsp;very long thread of&nbsp;people who&nbsp;have to&nbsp;juggle multiple accounts for&nbsp;work and&nbsp;stuff who&nbsp;would very much like that to&nbsp;be&nbsp;possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Maybe you can add your of your accounts as a collaborator to your other account’s repositories?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Collaboration is&nbsp;much more efficient. With the&nbsp;help of&nbsp;other members of&nbsp;the class it&nbsp;is much easier to&nbsp;complete assignments and&nbsp;compare different strategies to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;a conclusion&nbsp;together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It absolute is a much more fun (and then effective) learning experience.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I appreciate getting to&nbsp;choose our&nbsp;own partners and&nbsp;project themes. It&nbsp;allows us&nbsp;to actually be&nbsp;creative and&nbsp;get to&nbsp;design something that fits our&nbsp;personality style and&nbsp;interests. Thank you&nbsp;for letting us&nbsp;be creative and&nbsp;get to&nbsp;work with a&nbsp;partner/friend that we&nbsp;work well&nbsp;with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I want you to enjoy the class. It helps you learn.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">W3schools.com</a> is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;great&nbsp;resource.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always. Although, recently, I’ve been using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> more often.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I was&nbsp;not 100% confident in&nbsp;how grow, shrink and&nbsp;basis affected elements but&nbsp;this video at&nbsp;around 8&nbsp;minutes really clarified the&nbsp;concepts to&nbsp;me and&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;visualize&nbsp;everything: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Thanks for sharing, Ashley Hiraoka!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One site that I&nbsp;found useful while looking for&nbsp;interesting design projects to&nbsp;save to&nbsp;my reference board was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank">pentagram.com</a>. I&nbsp;also found a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;good stuff on&nbsp;Behance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Pentagram has been for a few decades now my favorite design studio. Three years ago, I had the opportunity to meet Michael&nbsp;Bierut, who was incredibly kind. (And I&nbsp;hear Paula Scher is no different.)</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I saw&nbsp;from the&nbsp;HTML file this week how&nbsp;to create a&nbsp;form with text inputs and&nbsp;checkboxes. Even though we’re not&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;touch the&nbsp;HTML, I&nbsp;still like going through it&nbsp;to see&nbsp;what each section&nbsp;contains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I hope you do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I need to&nbsp;repeat “grow, shrink, basis, grow, shrink basis” until it&nbsp;is forever engrained into my&nbsp;head!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’d write it down instead.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I think you&nbsp;mentioned us&nbsp;combining flexbox with grids later on, so&nbsp;I’m interested to&nbsp;see how&nbsp;that turns out. When do&nbsp;we use&nbsp;flexbox and&nbsp;when do&nbsp;we use&nbsp;grids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">There’s no hard rule. But in general, I use grid when I have more control of the layout and Flexbox when I want the layout adapt to different kind of contents. We’ll see more of that with the responsive layout for the magazine in module&nbsp;7.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I will be&nbsp;using the&nbsp;color technique when figuring out&nbsp;what changes in&nbsp;my&nbsp;code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I find it quite helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Why is&nbsp;it better to&nbsp;use grids instead of&nbsp;flex containers for&nbsp;the whole&nbsp;webpage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It isn’t. I prefer it, because it gives me more control. Some people prefer Flexbox, and that’s ok too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Excited to&nbsp;potentially learn about how&nbsp;to do&nbsp;animations in&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, we have some animated transition in the photo gallery assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;content of&nbsp;our website, will we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;write the&nbsp;articles ourselves or&nbsp;can we&nbsp;use articles that already&nbsp;exists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can get them from somewhere else.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;a little nervous to&nbsp;start the&nbsp;magazine. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;intimidating starting code from scratch or&nbsp;diving into a&nbsp;large project. I’m working on&nbsp;it alone, so&nbsp;we’ll see&nbsp;if I&nbsp;regret that in&nbsp;a few&nbsp;weeks : /</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Don’t be nervous. We’ll go step by step, like the New Kids On The Block did. (Boy, was that song overplayed, you have no idea, ask someone who was teenager in the 90s like I was.) Anyway…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I wonder how&nbsp;confusing it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;combining grids and&nbsp;flex&nbsp;containers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Extremely confusing! I’m&nbsp;kidding; it’s not that complicated. You will use one or the other to achieve different things, such as the overall structure of the page and just one part. You can see it in the photo gallery assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;super excited for&nbsp;the magazine project. I&nbsp;could definitely see&nbsp;this being on&nbsp;my portfolio and&nbsp;being a&nbsp;piece that I&nbsp;am super proud&nbsp;of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m sure it will. I look forward to seeing it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Also looking forward to&nbsp;having our&nbsp;typeface booklets from 322&nbsp;printed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Oh, yes. That. I need volunteers.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>How do&nbsp;I&nbsp;explain the&nbsp;difference between a&nbsp;markup language (HTML) and&nbsp;a programming language (like Python) to&nbsp;my mother? Please, I&nbsp;need help….</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let me know when you find out.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I love working with HTML/CSS, I&nbsp;think its&nbsp;so so&nbsp;fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I think so too. You’re my people.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I took a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;that link included in&nbsp;last weeks class journal about customizing your iPhone’s screen and&nbsp;turning off&nbsp;certain screens, that’s so&nbsp;rad!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s a new thing on iOS. I’ve playing with it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Unrelated to&nbsp;the class, but&nbsp;do you&nbsp;have any&nbsp;opinions on&nbsp;NFTs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Not strong opinions, because I&nbsp;don’t know much about it. But my opinions are not very favorable. I don’t think they make much sense, they don’t help the artistic community as much as it’s often claimed, and they seem to be terrible for the environment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>What is&nbsp;your favorite place to&nbsp;get comfort&nbsp;food?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">My favorite fast food places in town are Five&nbsp;Guys, Chipotle, and&nbsp;Pokirito. When I’m travelling or just going out with my family, I&nbsp;enjoy a good burger with some local beer. Milestone&nbsp;Tavern and Nucci’s&nbsp;on&nbsp;Broad are some of our favorite in my family.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>This week has&nbsp;been&nbsp;hectic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Tell me about it, my friend. Can we hope for a less hectic February?</p>
