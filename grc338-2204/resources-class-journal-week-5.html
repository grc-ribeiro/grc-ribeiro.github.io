<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;5  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>How is&nbsp;it already week 6????</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Time flies like an arrow. And fruit flies like a banana.”</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Were there no&nbsp;highlights from last week? I&nbsp;did not&nbsp;realize I&nbsp;never read week 4&nbsp;highlights until I&nbsp;was writing this week’s&nbsp;journal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course there were! I read all entries, selected some, and did write my comments. I only forgot to make them available to you. Thanks for pointing that out!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>On a&nbsp;related note, I&nbsp;really enjoy writing these journals since they make reflect on&nbsp;what I&nbsp;learned and&nbsp;what stood out&nbsp;the most to&nbsp;me this week from all&nbsp;the new&nbsp;information that was&nbsp;thrown at&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always enjoyed reading them. Even more so now that I can’t chat with you all in the lab (while you would be trying to concentrate on your code).</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Even through this has&nbsp;been the&nbsp;largest project so&nbsp;far, I&nbsp;am struggling the&nbsp;least. The&nbsp;past weeks have prepared me&nbsp;well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the plan.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like the&nbsp;progression from week to&nbsp;week is&nbsp;really helping me&nbsp;remember the&nbsp;material and&nbsp;how to&nbsp;code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But don’t forget that you can go back to the videos, to your notes, to other resources. You don’t need to <em>remember</em> everything.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;still a&nbsp;little bit&nbsp;confused on&nbsp;lists in&nbsp;HTML, and&nbsp;the appropriate ways to&nbsp;use them. I&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;basic functions of&nbsp;ul/ol, but&nbsp;it gets a&nbsp;bit complicated for&nbsp;me when the&nbsp;lists get&nbsp;more&nbsp;complicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me know if you want any specific help. But the <a href="resources-mistakes-lists-and-list-items.html">page on different uses of list</a> tends to help.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I really wanted to&nbsp;use negative margins/padding even though I&nbsp;know it’s&nbsp;wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really don’t need them, unless you’re actually overlapping elements. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to&nbsp;investigate different ways other companies use&nbsp;the “float” option, and&nbsp;how they incorporate it&nbsp;into their website design. I&nbsp;found the&nbsp;float option useful, but&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ll work more on it next week.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Im not&nbsp;100% sure when to&nbsp;use divs and&nbsp;what is&nbsp;appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use divs to groups elements together in a section of the page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This was&nbsp;a good refresher on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;add line breaks to&nbsp;paragraph tags in&nbsp;HTML!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please avoid the break tag!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like I&nbsp;100% understand how&nbsp;HTML and&nbsp;CSS work together to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;website, however based on&nbsp;how my&nbsp;restaurant website looks right now&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t feel confident that I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;very professional looking&nbsp;website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, right now, it should look like a skeleton of a website.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to&nbsp;pay closer attention to&nbsp;the specific wording of&nbsp;the code in&nbsp;lecture videos. I&nbsp;often have to&nbsp;reference back at&nbsp;it when completing projects or&nbsp;the&nbsp;quizzes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing wrong with referencing back at it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned that the&nbsp;internet is&nbsp;my friend and&nbsp;there are&nbsp;so many helpful resources online for&nbsp;when I&nbsp;can’t figure something&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always good to search for solutions on the internet. But don’t forget to check the list of mistakes to avoid.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>That the&nbsp;period at&nbsp;the end&nbsp;of the&nbsp;alt attribute text tells screen readers to&nbsp;pause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a small thing we can do to do help someone who can’t see.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m probably going to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time on&nbsp;Illustrator next week to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;restaurant’s&nbsp;logo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, don’t. Keep it simple.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Im not&nbsp;sure if&nbsp;I&nbsp;mentioned last week, but&nbsp;learning to&nbsp;apply font from the&nbsp;Adobe Creative Cloud into the&nbsp;CSS felt very&nbsp;beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is. And it’s quite straight&#8209;forward. Also, the typefaces selection is much better than on Google Fonts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I really liked learning about Horror Vacui because that’s a&nbsp;tendency that I&nbsp;often fall into. I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;fill up&nbsp;white space with “things", but&nbsp;taking this class and&nbsp;reading about this reminds me&nbsp;that white space could be&nbsp;good and&nbsp;could signify minimalism and&nbsp;prestige.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And remember that blank space in not necessarily white. A big area with solid color is blank space and, depending on the color, just as effective to convey higher&#8209;end/expensive products.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I was&nbsp;unaware of&nbsp;the influence face-ism ratio had&nbsp;over designs, though I&nbsp;understood expressions and&nbsp;poses had&nbsp;obvious power over a&nbsp;design, I&nbsp;honestly thought that the&nbsp;proximity of&nbsp;the face was&nbsp;mostly aesthetic&nbsp;preference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many times it is. And we do without thinking what’s the effect it has on the viewer’s perception of the portrayed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve never really thought about how&nbsp;arbitrary icons aren’t direct representations of&nbsp;what they stand&nbsp;for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really is hard to miss it, because we just understand them. But as designers, if we’re going to design or use icons, we need to look at them more carefully.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning that there is&nbsp;a name to&nbsp;a concept I&nbsp;could never identify or&nbsp;exactly describe was&nbsp;cool! Now&nbsp;I&nbsp;can add&nbsp;horror-vacui to&nbsp;my&nbsp;vocabulary!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And one of the goals of learning the design principles is to help you explain your design choices.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Also glad that we&nbsp;don’t have to&nbsp;do those peer evaluations anymore because I&nbsp;did not&nbsp;see them doing&nbsp;much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You never <em>had</em> to do them. But there’re still open. Nothing’s changed.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Learned (FINALLY) how&nbsp;to get&nbsp;100% on&nbsp;the design principle example because my&nbsp;group communicated with you&nbsp;to confirm screenshots and&nbsp;to go&nbsp;over our&nbsp;paragraphs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The dynamic of&nbsp;the discussion rooms are&nbsp;getting much&nbsp;better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good to know. Although…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I found this week’s discussion post to&nbsp;be the&nbsp;most disorganized and&nbsp;am still working on&nbsp;the most efficient way&nbsp;to work in&nbsp;groups&nbsp;virtually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry to hear that. It’s clearly not perfect, although it wasn’t perfect in the classroom either. Group work is never really perfect, but it’s really valuable when it goes well.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Choosing good fonts and&nbsp;layouts is&nbsp;still difficult, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;get better by&nbsp;trying out&nbsp;more things while being as&nbsp;consistent and&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being consistent and simple are good strategies. Also, look for references.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t wait to&nbsp;style and&nbsp;see the&nbsp;finished&nbsp;product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I look forward to seeing your best work.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be&nbsp;very interesting, since one&nbsp;menu item for&nbsp;our assignment is&nbsp;the location, how&nbsp;to link for&nbsp;example Google Maps or&nbsp;other location services on&nbsp;the&nbsp;webpage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s quite straight&#8209;forward. I found this <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-embed-google-map">tutorial on how to embed Google Maps</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Would be&nbsp;we able to&nbsp;code our&nbsp;own portfolio&nbsp;website?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but I wouldn’t necessarily encourage you. You’d be probably better served with some of the pre-built services out there.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A joke my&nbsp;friend told me&nbsp;in high school:. What do you call an alligator in a vest? An in-vest-igator. Stephanie Tang_</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A super cool event I&nbsp;found: Free webinar from the&nbsp;UX leadership at&nbsp;Domo (<a href="https://www.domo.com/">https://www.domo.com/</a>) on&nbsp;May 21st! Register here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/talks/data-driven-decision-making-in-design">https://www.invisionapp.com/talks/data-driven-decision-making-in-design</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, Kyra!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This week on&nbsp;Zoom University, the&nbsp;weather has&nbsp;gotten&nbsp;warmer and&nbsp;students are&nbsp;dreaming of&nbsp;summer nights and&nbsp;no more&nbsp;homework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ll be there soon. Although, many of you will be in GRC&nbsp;339 with me.</p>
