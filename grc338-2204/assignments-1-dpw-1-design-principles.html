<h1>Design principles examples  </h1>

<p>Every week, we&rsquo;ll be discussing four different design principles from the <em>Universal principles of design</em> book. <a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/calpoly/reader.action?docID=3399678">The book can be read online for free through the Cal Poly library</a>.</p>

<p>After taking the quiz about the four principles of the week, check the group discussion on Canvas. Each week, you will be assigned to a different group, and each group is assigned to a different principle. (Twelve groups total, three groups per topic, but you only need to work with your own group.)</p>

<p>Your group must find <strong>at least two images</strong> to  represent the principle <strong>assigned to your group</strong>. </p>

<p>One image should be of a physical product and the other should show a website. (An app is not a website.)</p>

<p>Write <strong>one paragraph for each image</strong>, explaining why it is an example of <strong>good design</strong> and <strong>good use</strong> of the principle. Use the theory of the book as well as your own words.  Submit your paragraph descriptions as online text on Canvas. Do not write your name, the name of the principle, date, or anything. <strong>Write two and only two paragraphs per submission:</strong> in the first paragraph, you write about the physical example; in the second paragraph, you write about the website example.</p>

<p>Each image should be <strong>1200px wide, at least</strong>. </p>

<p>Read these tips on how to <a href="resources-how-to-take-good-screenshots-of-webpages-on-a-mac.html">take a good screenshot on a Mac</a>. </p>

<p>Submit two image to Canvas using this name convention:</p>

<ol>
<li>The word <code>group</code>, followed by your <strong>group number</strong>.  </li>
<li>A hyphen(<code>&#8209;</code>) (again, not underscore).  </li>
<li>Number <code>1</code> for the physical example; or <code>2</code> for the web example.  </li>
<li>An optional sequencial <em>lowercase</em> letter, in case you have additional images for the same example.</li>
</ol>

<p>(If you want to submit more than one image, just add lowercase letters after the numbers: <em>group1-1a.png</em>, <em>group1-1b.png</em>, etc., but keep the physical examples as #1 and web design examples as #2.)</p>

<p>Please submit the text as comments on Canvas.</p>

<p>No example designed by Apple, Google, or Netflix allowed.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="resources-design-principle-examples.html">two examples of submissions</a>, so you can have a better idea on how to write your paragraphs and how to name your image files.</p>

<p>On Mondays, the quiz, the discussion, and the assignment will be open on Canvas.</p>

<p>On Tuesdays, you should be engaging in the asynchronous, online discussion on Canvas.</p>

<p>On Wednesdays, someone in your group will be submitting the assignment for the whole group on Canvas.</p>

<p>On Thursdays, I will grade all the submissions.</p>

<p>On Fridays, I will post a video with the analysis of each example.</p>
