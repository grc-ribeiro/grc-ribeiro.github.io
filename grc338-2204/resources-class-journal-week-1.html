<h1>Class journal, week 1  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you&nbsp;individually respond to&nbsp;everyone&rsquo;s Google&nbsp;survey?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned that I&nbsp;am tired of&nbsp;being quarantined and&nbsp;even my&nbsp;dog is&nbsp;tired from all&nbsp;the walks I&rsquo;m taking him&nbsp;on and&nbsp;that I&rsquo;ll never complain about going to&nbsp;class&nbsp;again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hear you…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Making my&nbsp;own routine during the&nbsp;week will&nbsp;be hard at&nbsp;times. Much of&nbsp;my success in&nbsp;this class will depend on&nbsp;how well I&nbsp;can manage my&nbsp;work at&nbsp;home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And although there can be extenuating circumstances, my advice is to have a routine. Have a specific time to start your day. Make sure to set an alarm, so you can have breakfast (and probably shower) before &ldquo;school starts&rdquo;. Set breaks for meals and healthy snacks. Don&rsquo;t forget to include the time for exercising or at least a walk outside. Work-from-home was already in our future before COVID-19, but it was accelerated and it is now something your generation will see a lot.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The learning &ldquo;styles&rdquo; that I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;hearing about are&nbsp;a&nbsp;myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Having multiple online courses is&nbsp;new for&nbsp;all of&nbsp;us, and&nbsp;this class&rsquo;s consistent weekly schedule helps alleviate the&nbsp;stress of&nbsp;online&nbsp;courses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I figured it would. Like I said before, I don&rsquo;t want to add unnecessary stress to your lives.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking forward to&nbsp;learning more about HTML, I&nbsp;think it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;super valuable skill and&nbsp;I&nbsp;love how&nbsp;it feels like a&nbsp;brain puzzle to&nbsp;figure&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, more than a &ldquo;super valuable skill&rdquo;, it can be fun. And can help you with how to approach design.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I&nbsp;learned from this weeks project on&nbsp;github was&nbsp;that in&nbsp;order for&nbsp;my url&nbsp;to work, the&nbsp;repository had&nbsp;to be&nbsp;public. While it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;while for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;that that was&nbsp;issue, I&nbsp;eventually got&nbsp;it up&nbsp;and&nbsp;running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not realize that, until students mentioned it to me. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>From the&nbsp;discussion, a&nbsp;student brought up&nbsp;how the&nbsp;GrC department utilized the&nbsp;tree model in&nbsp;the course sequence chart which and&nbsp;it was&nbsp;a cool way&nbsp;to see&nbsp;how useful hierarchy can&nbsp;be in&nbsp;presenting information&nbsp;clearly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was certainly a hit.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Previous to&nbsp;this week, I&nbsp;understood the&nbsp;design concepts we&nbsp;reviewed, but&nbsp;seeing examples and&nbsp;actually discussing them with peers gave me&nbsp;a much deeper&nbsp;understanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope the online discussions get even better while we all adjust to the format.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned more about Github from a&nbsp;friend who&nbsp;has used it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do share.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I should start a&nbsp;HTML/CSS project early on&nbsp;and not&nbsp;wait until the&nbsp;last minute to&nbsp;do them so&nbsp;I&nbsp;can email if&nbsp;I&nbsp;run into any&nbsp;complications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, please!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This week was&nbsp;a very interesting first week of&nbsp;classes. With everything being online I&nbsp;was definitely tested. I&nbsp;learned how&nbsp;hard it&nbsp;is for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;sit down and&nbsp;focus when I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t need to&nbsp;be physically present in&nbsp;a classroom. I&nbsp;also learned how&nbsp;frustrated I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;get when I&nbsp;can&rsquo;t figure something out&nbsp;and don&rsquo;t have the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;ask a&nbsp;question right away. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;feeling that it&nbsp;is going to&nbsp;happen a&nbsp;lot for&nbsp;me with the&nbsp;HTML and&nbsp;CSS projects because it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;something that comes easy to&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder how it&rsquo;ll go too. Students usually work very independently in my labs, but they do have immediate from other students or from me. Since it won&rsquo;t be the case, <strong>how about we try Canvas Chat for peer-to-peer help in the HTML/CSS assignments?</strong></p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned what GitHub is, and&nbsp;so far&nbsp;it is&nbsp;easier and&nbsp;more user friendly than other sites/software that I&nbsp;have attempted coding&nbsp;with!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish it had worked that well for everybody, but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Although it&nbsp;was cool, I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t think it&nbsp;was very necessary for&nbsp;the design principles assignment to&nbsp;be in&nbsp;a group of&nbsp;4-5, it&nbsp;seemed more like an&nbsp;assignment that can&nbsp;be done by&nbsp;ourselves or&nbsp;with a&nbsp;partner. I&nbsp;found that maybe some people didn&rsquo;t really&nbsp;participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Groups are necessary to have a discussion, but starting this week, we&rsquo;ll have a peer evaluation survey to make sure everybody is participating. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Early communication with group members is&nbsp;important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. Try to establish contact on Monday.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Group work will be&nbsp;more difficult online. Since we&nbsp;can&rsquo;t work together in&nbsp;a physical class setting, communication between group members will depend on&nbsp;how well we&nbsp;can all&nbsp;check on&nbsp;our discussion&nbsp;posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I loved being able to&nbsp;go through my&nbsp;group&rsquo;s discussion posts to&nbsp;see what research they have done, it&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;topics&nbsp;further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a benefit of the discussion board. It leaves a trace.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the&nbsp;biggest issue with this project was&nbsp;figuring out&nbsp;a way&nbsp;to best communicate. Personally, I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t like how&nbsp;the discussion board is&nbsp;formatted on&nbsp;Canvas, as&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;scroll down to&nbsp;the bottom every time someone writes a&nbsp;new message and&nbsp;have to&nbsp;keep expanding the&nbsp;page to&nbsp;&ldquo;see more&rdquo; to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the most recent messages - usually it&nbsp;is the&nbsp;opposite. As&nbsp;the quarter goes on&nbsp;we will get&nbsp;more used to&nbsp;this, but&nbsp;I&rsquo;m wondering if&nbsp;there&rsquo;s a&nbsp;more efficient way&nbsp;to communicate with&nbsp;groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ll figure it out together. It&rsquo;s my first time teaching online, and this is isn&rsquo;t a fully vetted online class. It&rsquo;s moved to emergencial online format, which is very different.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>It&rsquo;s still a&nbsp;little difficult to&nbsp;get used to&nbsp;an asynchronous class, I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;have one&nbsp;class discussion a&nbsp;week (for questions and&nbsp;other main topic conversations, since some people might have the&nbsp;same questions and&nbsp;could help each other or&nbsp;get their answers all&nbsp;at the&nbsp;same time from you).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Class will be asynchronous. But there&rsquo;s Canvas Chat for HTML/CSS peer help and the group discussion boards for the design principles. I&rsquo;ll be monitoring them both as I keep checking email. I&rsquo;ll also create a FAQ page in case the questions are being repeated.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>How do&nbsp;UX/ UI&nbsp;designers determine their final&nbsp;prototypes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great question. And the best approach is to rely on tests with users and a set of criteria.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I also was&nbsp;slightly confused by&nbsp;what distinguishes iteration and&nbsp;prototypes in&nbsp;general. I&nbsp;see how&nbsp;they&rsquo;re different but&nbsp;each one&nbsp;seems like the&nbsp;designer starting with something, testing it, and&nbsp;then building upon the&nbsp;idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s definitely overlapping, as it&rsquo;ll be the case with several principles that we&rsquo;ll visit in class. Iterations may or may not include different prototypes. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;very excited to&nbsp;continue learning about the&nbsp;design principles. People uneducated on&nbsp;design feel that it&nbsp;is all&nbsp;personal opinion about whether a&nbsp;design is&nbsp;good or&nbsp;not. However, there are&nbsp;principles and&nbsp;reasonings to&nbsp;why a&nbsp;design is&nbsp;the way&nbsp;it is. I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;person always curious to&nbsp;find the&nbsp;why, and&nbsp;design principles are&nbsp;the concrete why&rsquo;s to&nbsp;designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Knowing the principles makes our work easier.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I really enjoyed reading about the&nbsp;concept of&nbsp;the aesthetic-usability effect. It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve always known in&nbsp;my head, maybe subconsciously, but&nbsp;never had&nbsp;the words and&nbsp;terminology to&nbsp;describe&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will happen. Many of the principles will be concepts that we kind of knew before, but it really helps to have a name for it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>In my&nbsp;group discussion board, we&nbsp;were reminded aesthetic affects the&nbsp;perception of&nbsp;usability more so&nbsp;than&nbsp;desirability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. What I meant was that the principle related to usability and that should be the focus of your example. But aesthetics may affect more desirability than usability, but it&rsquo;s just not the subject of the principle.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Prototyping is&nbsp;used in&nbsp;<strong>everything</strong>! Everything that we&nbsp;use on&nbsp;our day-to-day operations requires some type of&nbsp;prototyping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s everything, but it clearly relates to a lot of areas, not only design.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The ability to&nbsp;categorize prototyping was&nbsp;also something new&nbsp;that I&nbsp;found that I&nbsp;believe will help me&nbsp;in the&nbsp;future to&nbsp;recognize how&nbsp;to best show an&nbsp;idea and&nbsp;where the&nbsp;pitfalls might&nbsp;be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a very good point. I&rsquo;ve mentioned several times how you need to plan your prototype for what you want to learn, but it&rsquo;s also for what you want to show.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Topics that I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;investigate: How&nbsp;color/color schemes can&nbsp;change someone&rsquo;s perception about a&nbsp;design, how&nbsp;optimal aesthetic is&nbsp;achieved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will talk about color next week, but there is no science for &ldquo;optimal aesthetic&rdquo;. The best strategy is to look a lot at good design, which is one of the reasons I want good examples of good design in the assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the&nbsp;textbook to&nbsp;be very easy to&nbsp;read, understand, and&nbsp;navigate! It&nbsp;was the&nbsp;resource that helped me&nbsp;the most for&nbsp;the group&nbsp;discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful book. I highly recommend buying either the physical or the digital copy.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>In my&nbsp;next projects I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;designs more accessible on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;just making them aesthetically&nbsp;pleasing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accessibility will be a big point of this class.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I especially enjoyed the&nbsp;selfie with Aaron&nbsp;Draplin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m slightly disappointed that not many people wrote that.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>What are&nbsp;your thought on&nbsp;password managers like suggested in&nbsp;the passwords link you&nbsp;reference in&nbsp;the GitHub instructions? I&rsquo;ve thought about using one&nbsp;but wonder if&nbsp;people actually do&nbsp;use them or&nbsp;if they don&rsquo;t because… if&nbsp;someone gets in&nbsp;there then they&rsquo;d have everything? Just&nbsp;wondering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great question. I believe you should all use it. But some of my most important passwords (Cal Poly, bank, and personal email) I leave out. You should also use two-factor authentication wherever it&rsquo;s available.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Joke: </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the&nbsp;difference between ignorance and&nbsp;apathy? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't know and I don't care.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Why are&nbsp;ghosts such bad&nbsp;liars? </p>

<p>Because they are&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;see&nbsp;through! </p>

</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This whole online learning thing isn&rsquo;t as&nbsp;bad as&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought is&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We got it!</p>
