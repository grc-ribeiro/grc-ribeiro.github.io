<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;5  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned that office hours are&nbsp;so helpful and&nbsp;everyone should make use&nbsp;of the&nbsp;knowledge and&nbsp;help you&nbsp;have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m always happy to help.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I need to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;my mental health and&nbsp;sometimes that means taking a&nbsp;break instead of&nbsp;overworking&nbsp;myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do take your breaks, then.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish we&nbsp;could share this stuff in&nbsp;person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too. I look forward to being on campus at least for office hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This class is&nbsp;starting to&nbsp;get tough but&nbsp;more&nbsp;exciting!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s getting more challenging.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I really enjoy that the&nbsp;HTML/CSS videos are&nbsp;short and&nbsp;concise. It&nbsp;not only helps me&nbsp;retain the&nbsp;information but&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;go back and&nbsp;answer questions I&nbsp;have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are always there for you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>For the&nbsp;project I’m currently working on&nbsp;getting my&nbsp;menu to&nbsp;look nice, next I&nbsp;will use&nbsp;div classes to&nbsp;style my&nbsp;separate&nbsp;pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure you need them, though. You want to keep the pages consistent.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I actually missed the&nbsp;videos and&nbsp;quizzes this week because they help me&nbsp;learn the&nbsp;material and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am finding that I&nbsp;really enjoy this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have one last video this week.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn’t get&nbsp;a phenomenal grade on&nbsp;this week’s website assignment, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;took some time to&nbsp;refine errors in&nbsp;my code and&nbsp;in doing so&nbsp;re-watched some videos from last week to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better&nbsp;grasp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of you are missing points for not checking the list of mistakes to avoid rather than not understanding HTML/CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m confused why&nbsp;some divs will be&nbsp;centered but&nbsp;won’t match up&nbsp;with my&nbsp;OTHER centered&nbsp;divs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that there’s a default padding pushing the list to the right.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;embed a&nbsp;font that is&nbsp;locally stored on&nbsp;your computer? For&nbsp;example, one&nbsp;that I&nbsp;have downloaded on&nbsp;my computer but&nbsp;is not&nbsp;available on&nbsp;Google fonts or&nbsp;Adobe&nbsp;fonts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s technically possible, but you would have to upload the file, making it available to anyone to download it, which is illegal. So no.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The thought of&nbsp;having 20&nbsp;points taken off&nbsp;per mistake I&nbsp;make is&nbsp;horrifying but&nbsp;it’s also making me&nbsp;double-check everything I&nbsp;am doing, which is&nbsp;the bright&nbsp;side!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the goal! I hate taking points off. That’s why I made them so many for each penalty; I hope that you will avoid them all.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>When I&nbsp;check my&nbsp;website on&nbsp;my phone, the&nbsp;fonts don’t show up&nbsp;and it&nbsp;goes to&nbsp;default, but&nbsp;once I&nbsp;check on&nbsp;my computer it’s fine. Does that&nbsp;matter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like you have some settings on your phone blocking custom fonts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I always put&nbsp;my code into some HTML formatter because even though the&nbsp;code looks pretty neat to&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;always looks better when I&nbsp;put it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;formatter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;learning a&nbsp;lot about HTML/CSS because having to&nbsp;troubleshoot on&nbsp;my own&nbsp;has helped me&nbsp;remember certain concepts. I&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;benefit of&nbsp;virtual classes is&nbsp;that I&nbsp;really try&nbsp;to figure things out&nbsp;on my&nbsp;own before reaching out&nbsp;to&nbsp;professors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I’ve been known for not answering the questions before letting the students struggle a bit in the lab.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the&nbsp;CSS tips page that you&nbsp;created very helpful because I&nbsp;wasn’t sure how&nbsp;to resize an&nbsp;image in&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m glad it helped. Please, let me know what else I can add to the page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish to&nbsp;investigate Javascript, although I&nbsp;know that there is&nbsp;a GrC&nbsp;class on&nbsp;it that I&nbsp;get to&nbsp;take in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GRC&nbsp;452 with Dina Vees this summer!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I would really like to&nbsp;know the&nbsp;easiest way&nbsp;to center text on&nbsp;the screen. I&nbsp;increase the&nbsp;margins and&nbsp;paddings but&nbsp;is there an&nbsp;easier or&nbsp;more efficient&nbsp;way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s on the page I sent with CSS tips.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a&nbsp;certain way&nbsp;to sort your CSS&nbsp;code? Mine just looks like a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;classes and&nbsp;their attributes one&nbsp;after&nbsp;another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are online tools to organize your CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>That there are&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;people online who&nbsp;make great posts about doing simple things in&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very true. Is it kind of fascinating?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>W3Schools is&nbsp;still very useful as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I was&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;see Spotify in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the group’s examples for&nbsp;wayfinding. Many people look to&nbsp;them as&nbsp;a good example of&nbsp;design and&nbsp;I&nbsp;can see&nbsp;why. Man, their design team is&nbsp;doing&nbsp;well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is indeed a very good design team.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Creating moodboards and&nbsp;sketching out&nbsp;thumbnails has&nbsp;been very beneficial for&nbsp;me during the&nbsp;CSS stages for&nbsp;our projects. While it&nbsp;seems like more work, it&nbsp;has made making my&nbsp;design decisions a&nbsp;lot easier and&nbsp;I&nbsp;would definitely&nbsp;recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moodboards and references are essential and pay off!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I find doing a&nbsp;final check through of&nbsp;my code on&nbsp;Github to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;good way&nbsp;to make sure I&nbsp;am not&nbsp;making careless errors. Github displays the&nbsp;code in&nbsp;one window and&nbsp;is less distracting than&nbsp;brackets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always find it helpful to check my work on a different environment than the one I was working on. It’s like checking your page layout on a PDF rather than on the InDesign file.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve found that trial and&nbsp;error has&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;to experience using CSS&nbsp;better than just looking up&nbsp;the answer right away on&nbsp;Google.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. There’s a healthy amount of struggling that’s helpful and fun before it gets frustrating. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>When creating the&nbsp;website, I&nbsp;felt like I&nbsp;was using so&nbsp;many different classes but&nbsp;they were necessary because many of&nbsp;the elements needed to&nbsp;look&nbsp;different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure they’re really necessary.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I&nbsp;learned this week was&nbsp;to always submit the&nbsp;design principles early for&nbsp;approval to&nbsp;ensure a&nbsp;100% since all&nbsp;of my&nbsp;group missed some details that caused us&nbsp;to lose&nbsp;points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Please, do!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This week’s group discussion was&nbsp;so much more efficient. I’ve come to&nbsp;the conclusion that it&nbsp;really depends on&nbsp;the people in&nbsp;your&nbsp;group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does. It isn’t always perfect, but when it isn’t, you move on to the different group in the following week.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout learning these design principles, I&nbsp;become more and&nbsp;more fascinated putting a&nbsp;name to&nbsp;design decisions we&nbsp;look at&nbsp;every&nbsp;day!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. That’s the main point of learning them. It’s not that you will learn something completely new. You will put name on somewhat familiar concepts, which is helpful for you to use them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I do&nbsp;wish the&nbsp;class taught how&nbsp;to implement more interactive elements within a&nbsp;page such as&nbsp;text that appears as&nbsp;you scroll or&nbsp;designing for&nbsp;both computers and&nbsp;mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ll design for both laptop and mobile this week. But more interactive elements require Javascript. Take a look at Dina Vees’s GRC&nbsp;452 this summer.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A resource I&nbsp;found: Design Details is&nbsp;a great podcast for&nbsp;the UX&nbsp;design field. They cover everything from interaction design, designing with language (content writing), “how they got&nbsp;there", visual design, research, path of&nbsp;a generalist, unicorns, and&nbsp;waaaay more!&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7kAx8RJce757LXVoX2FIpf?si=YWs7HbY1Q6OFMseXWJNqEw">https://open.spotify.com/show/7kAx8RJce757LXVoX2FIpf?si=YWs7HbY1Q6OFMseXWJNqEw</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, Kyra!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I finally figured out&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;screenshots look nice! Took long enough but&nbsp;definitely makes a&nbsp;difference with the&nbsp;presentation! For&nbsp;those still struggling that have a&nbsp;Mac with a&nbsp;touch bar&nbsp;– there are&nbsp;3 icons that appear showing EXACTLY how&nbsp;much of&nbsp;the screen will be&nbsp;captured (which is&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;easier than dragging your cursor across). I&nbsp;did not&nbsp;realize that until this week, so&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would share:).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve never noticed it. I don’t use the Touch Bar that often, so I usually don’t even look at it, I guess.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I really liked the&nbsp;week 6&nbsp;article on&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;natural talent. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;often have trouble finding design ideas, it&nbsp;is motivating to&nbsp;hear that skill and&nbsp;experience are&nbsp;the most important pillars of&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. There’s no natural talent. All it takes is making smart (and informed) decisions.</p>
