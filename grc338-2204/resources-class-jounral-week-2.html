<h1>Class journal, week 2  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I also am&nbsp;trying my&nbsp;hardest to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;routine to&nbsp;follow every day&nbsp;so that I&nbsp;stay up&nbsp;to date with my&nbsp;work even though all&nbsp;of my&nbsp;classes are&nbsp;asynchronous. Creating a&nbsp;schedule makes it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;get work done even on&nbsp;the days I&nbsp;am feeling especially lazy or&nbsp;tired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. I have to have my routine as well. If you only sit to work when you feel like it, you&rsquo;ll never get to it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I dislike group discussion examples I&nbsp;believe. It&nbsp;is somewhat difficult to&nbsp;get everyone to&nbsp;participate simply online, although it&nbsp;is a&nbsp;nice thought. It&nbsp;seems like in&nbsp;both weeks there are&nbsp;pretty much only 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;people that take charge and&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s perfect. But I couldn&rsquo;t come up with any better solution in the short time we had to move from in-person to emergencial online environment. I have seen, however, some rich discussion with everybody in the group participating.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m getting more used to&nbsp;the online format, it&rsquo;s still not&nbsp;my preferred format but&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll get&nbsp;the hang of&nbsp;it more every&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re all getting used to it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that it&nbsp;is the&nbsp;second week of&nbsp;classes I&nbsp;have fallen into a&nbsp;routine to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;submit assignments on&nbsp;time which has&nbsp;made my&nbsp;online classes easier to&nbsp;handle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very important. It&rsquo;d be easier if all classes had consistent deadlines, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;for having consistent dates for&nbsp;every assignment, I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;6 classes this quarter and&nbsp;this class is&nbsp;the most organized. It&nbsp;helps a&nbsp;lot and&nbsp;with planning and&nbsp;time&nbsp;management.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually less consistent in my structure, but I figured the class needed to be very structured. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Zoom meetings for&nbsp;the design principles group assignment are&nbsp;much more efficient than the&nbsp;discussion&nbsp;board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine to use it, but keep in mind that this is an asynchronous class, and those who can&rsquo;t make it to the Zoom meeting must have an opportunity to be heard.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Another thing I&nbsp;learned was&nbsp;that it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;little bit&nbsp;for my&nbsp;github to&nbsp;work. I&nbsp;spent upwards of&nbsp;30 minutes staring at&nbsp;and trying to&nbsp;fix my&nbsp;code because the&nbsp;when I&nbsp;copied and&nbsp;pasted my&nbsp;URL, the&nbsp;screen would just come up&nbsp;blank. I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break and&nbsp;come back to&nbsp;it, and&nbsp;when I&nbsp;tried again an&nbsp;hour later, everything worked perfectly. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;learned I&nbsp;might have to&nbsp;be patient&nbsp;sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always behave like this, but it may.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>As the&nbsp;class gets more complex I&nbsp;am fearful of&nbsp;just memorizing formatting of&nbsp;code tags and&nbsp;their placement rather than really understanding the&nbsp;purpose of&nbsp;every&nbsp;tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t let it happen. Also, you don&rsquo;t need to memorize anything, you can have all the references you need at hand.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Checking previews of&nbsp;my HTML often helped me&nbsp;stay on&nbsp;track and&nbsp;identify which errors I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;fix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. Even though the assignment is evaluated on the HTML only, the preview is helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>For the&nbsp;Restaurant menu assignment, it&nbsp;felt very rewarding when I&nbsp;saw that it&nbsp;worked. I&nbsp;used Tryit Editor to&nbsp;test out&nbsp;my code and&nbsp;find any&nbsp;errors throughout, which was&nbsp;a really helpful resource throughout the&nbsp;assignment. W3Schools was&nbsp;a helpful resource that answered a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the questions and&nbsp;problems I&nbsp;ran into while completing this&nbsp;assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>W3Schools is a great resource, and I end up using it every time I sit down to write HTML or CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I also learned to&nbsp;be more careful about making sure that everything is&nbsp;spelled correctly (especially within a&nbsp;URL) and&nbsp;making sure to&nbsp;copy and&nbsp;paste instead of&nbsp;type things out&nbsp;to avoid&nbsp;this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Please, please, please, always copy and paste.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m confused about the&nbsp;name list because my&nbsp;website seems to&nbsp;be working when I&nbsp;type in&nbsp;the Url&nbsp;but I&nbsp;get the&nbsp;404 error code when I&nbsp;click on&nbsp;my name or&nbsp;anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, you should check with me. If you use the same repository name from last week and the URL I assigned, it should work. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m still confused about the&nbsp;HTML Formatter, is&nbsp;it necessary if&nbsp;it works without&nbsp;it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It&rsquo;ll work without it, but HTML Formatter and the likes will help your code be more organized for human beings to read it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>In HTML, does indentation matter? Like how&nbsp;much you&nbsp;indent <strong><ul></strong> for&nbsp;example will it&nbsp;make a&nbsp;difference?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does not make any difference for the browser or on how it will render your code. It does help human beings to read your code, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Learned how&nbsp;to properly make a&nbsp;list in&nbsp;HTML and&nbsp;style in&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to use any CSS at this point.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>There are&nbsp;some HTML tag&nbsp;concepts that are&nbsp;somewhat confusing for&nbsp;me and&nbsp;personally would like to&nbsp;have more specific directions/notes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could <em>you</em> be more specific?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The communication using canvas was&nbsp;easier this week, being that we&nbsp;had all&nbsp;done it&nbsp;the week before. I&nbsp;think going forward it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;easier for&nbsp;all of&nbsp;us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope so too. We&rsquo;re getting more comfortable with this transition from in-person to online.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>To post on&nbsp;discussions earlier to&nbsp;minimize stress for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like the&nbsp;menu assignment was&nbsp;straightforward, yet&nbsp;very time consuming. I&nbsp;am sure part of&nbsp;it is&nbsp;because I&nbsp;am still inexperienced with coding, but&nbsp;does it&nbsp;get significantly quicker as&nbsp;time&nbsp;passes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does. Especially if you use Find/Replace.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I thought classes would be&nbsp;easier online&mdash;I was&nbsp;wrong!! It&rsquo;s hard for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;figure it&nbsp;all out&nbsp;with being able to&nbsp;raise my&nbsp;hand and&nbsp;have my&nbsp;professor help me. Although, it&rsquo;s teaching me&nbsp;to figure things out&nbsp;on my&nbsp;own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if we were in the lab, I&rsquo;d have you figure it out on your own too. I&rsquo;m serious. It drives students mad in the beginning because I don&rsquo;t answer their questions directly. Eventually everybody learns to figure things out, which is a very important skill. If it comes too complicated, though, send me an email and/or set an appointment for my office hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>One important thing I&nbsp;also learned was&nbsp;to keep my&nbsp;code clean with tabs and&nbsp;spaces, cluttered code really affects debugging and&nbsp;readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a clean code helps those who will grade it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The page explaining how&nbsp;to code different lists was&nbsp;really&nbsp;helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I encourage everybody to take a careful look.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Similarity of&nbsp;color results in&nbsp;strongest grouping&rdquo; SWEEEET! Could be&nbsp;self-fulfilling prophecy but&nbsp;it&rsquo;s confirmation as&nbsp;to why&nbsp;color coding works really well for&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really is.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;also interested to&nbsp;learn about Weakest Link, I&nbsp;am slightly confused by&nbsp;the topic. (Funny story: two&nbsp;days ago&nbsp;my grandfather found a&nbsp;bike in&nbsp;the dumpster and&nbsp;fixed it&nbsp;up for&nbsp;me so&nbsp;I&nbsp;rode it&nbsp;for five minutes and&nbsp;the chain completely broke off. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;was laying on&nbsp;the ground I&nbsp;noticed the&nbsp;cause of&nbsp;this was&nbsp;due to&nbsp;one weak link that flew off. Once we&nbsp;fixed it, the&nbsp;bike was&nbsp;good as&nbsp;new because you&rsquo;re only as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;your weakest link.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We won&rsquo;t cover the weakest link principle in this class, but it shows how important it is to pay attention to every aspect of the design.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;powerpoint in&nbsp;my other GRC&nbsp;class and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am excited to&nbsp;apply these elements I&nbsp;have learned so&nbsp;far to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;the best in&nbsp;the&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, please to apply to everything that you design.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I enjoyed looking at&nbsp;the design principles examples and&nbsp;seeing how&nbsp;everyone interprets the&nbsp;design principles they were assigned to. CocaCola was&nbsp;mentioned twice for&nbsp;consistency which I&nbsp;thought showed how&nbsp;well CocaCola has&nbsp;developed their&nbsp;brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another group debated using Coca-Cola too, but went with another example.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m having a&nbsp;little difficulty thinking of&nbsp;and finding good examples of&nbsp;the design elements when at&nbsp;home. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;helpful if&nbsp;people shared their process of&nbsp;finding these examples or&nbsp;if there was&nbsp;a resource that we&nbsp;could use&nbsp;to do&nbsp;so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anybody has tips to share?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the&nbsp;textbook page for&nbsp;proximity was&nbsp;really brief, I&nbsp;used <a href="https://254-online.com/proximity-principle-design/">this website</a> to&nbsp;help me&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;principle better. It&nbsp;helped me&nbsp;to understand that proximity can&nbsp;trigger certain feelings in&nbsp;people that could leave them feeling connected or&nbsp;a sense of&nbsp;unease when something has&nbsp;awkward&nbsp;proximity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a good idea to investigate your topic further. Thanks for sharing the article!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This week we&nbsp;went over the&nbsp;principles of&nbsp;consistency, similarity, alignment and&nbsp;proximity. They definitely reminded me&nbsp;of the&nbsp;acronym &ldquo;CRAP&rdquo; which is&nbsp;almost identical, with the&nbsp;replacement of&nbsp;similarity with&nbsp;repetition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you may all remember these principles from GRC 318.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Apparently I&nbsp;still don&rsquo;t know how&nbsp;to take a&nbsp;good screenshot. I&nbsp;followed the&nbsp;instructions given on&nbsp;the class website, but&nbsp;our group still got&nbsp;marked downâ¦ any&nbsp;advice on&nbsp;how I&nbsp;could take an&nbsp;improved one&nbsp;next&nbsp;time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please follow the instructions carefully. It&rsquo;s not that complicated. <strong>Command+Shift+4</strong>, then hit the <strong>Space bar</strong>, the cursor will change into a camera. Then click on the browser window.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to&nbsp;learn more about element placement in&nbsp;CSS, but&nbsp;I&rsquo;m assuming that will come later in&nbsp;the course. I&rsquo;m unsure of&nbsp;how to&nbsp;correctly use&nbsp;padding and&nbsp;margins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get to it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Will we&nbsp;be coding a&nbsp;website that we&nbsp;could use&nbsp;in our&nbsp;portfolios?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you will.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Honestly, only when I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;type out&nbsp;this journal did&nbsp;I&nbsp;realize that all&nbsp;of these terms are&nbsp;for usability so&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;the journal for&nbsp;that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is good to have this point of reflection, right?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
