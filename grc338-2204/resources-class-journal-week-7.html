<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;7  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m feeling a&nbsp;lot more confident about HTML/CSS after all&nbsp;these weekly assignments, especially since the&nbsp;later assignments build on&nbsp;things we&nbsp;learned in&nbsp;previous assignments. I&nbsp;was nervous about building the&nbsp;restaurant website from scratch but&nbsp;as I&nbsp;worked on&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;realized that I&nbsp;actually knew what I&nbsp;was doing and&nbsp;everything made&nbsp;sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the goal!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>After emailing you&nbsp;and asking questions, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;better understanding of&nbsp;why we&nbsp;should be&nbsp;using % for&nbsp;width and&nbsp;em for&nbsp;height when creating&nbsp;divs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please keep emailing your questions or signing up for office hours.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Although I&nbsp;know the&nbsp;reasoning behind the&nbsp;double points for&nbsp;easily avoidable mistakes, the&nbsp;result is&nbsp;still very&nbsp;frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s the only way I found to make sure students will pay more attentions to the mistakes to avoid.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel a&nbsp;bit weird saying it&nbsp;but I&nbsp;am honestly grateful that we&nbsp;are marked down a&nbsp;significant amount on&nbsp;errors, and&nbsp;that they remain until fixed! I&nbsp;was shocked the&nbsp;first time it&nbsp;happened with my&nbsp;code missing little parts but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am certain I&nbsp;will not&nbsp;make those errors&nbsp; again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that’s the point. Unfortunately, that’s the only way I found to make sure students will pay more attentions to the mistakes to avoid.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Getting the&nbsp;sizing right for&nbsp;a background image is&nbsp;very difficult with different screen&nbsp;sizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be tricky. Media queries might be necessary then.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;curious, what are&nbsp;the drawbacks to&nbsp;using negative margin and&nbsp;paddings in&nbsp;a&nbsp;design?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a semantic issue. What you probably want to do is to make the previous element’s default margin zero. If you use negative margins instead, it may create a clash somewhere else. You want to keep your code clean and semantic for scalability.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I had&nbsp;trouble with trying to&nbsp;do block elements to&nbsp;chunk some float elements. I&nbsp;found on&nbsp;a mozilla page that there is&nbsp;a float option for&nbsp;“float: inline-start", which solved the&nbsp;problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That might be an interesting solution but don’t forget to test it in different browsers and devices to make sure it’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float#Browser_compatibility">compatible</a>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I started using Cody Beautify which I&nbsp;should have been doing from the&nbsp;start, and&nbsp;makes my&nbsp;code more clear, organized, and&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;understand and&nbsp;edit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It helps both you and me read your code.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>My one&nbsp;mistake using the&nbsp;color name instead of&nbsp;RGB(xx,xx,xx) on&nbsp;one line of&nbsp;CSS really tanked my&nbsp;grade this&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does! I bet you won’t make the same mistake again. Please, don’t!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The HTML/CSS website for&nbsp;mobile was&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;difficult because I&nbsp;didn’t know how&nbsp;to design it&nbsp;to fit&nbsp;onto the&nbsp;mobile, but&nbsp;once I&nbsp;got it&nbsp;it was&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;easy!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every website is suitable for mobile if you don’t do anything to make them unfit.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This has&nbsp;been the&nbsp;most tedious and&nbsp;hardest project. When everything looks good on&nbsp;one screen you&nbsp;go back to&nbsp;a different one&nbsp;and it’s all&nbsp;messed&nbsp;up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep it simple, and keep testing on all screen sizes as you make the changes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;a “mobile-friendly” web&nbsp;page vs&nbsp;a normal web&nbsp;page in&nbsp;regards to&nbsp;actually designing it&nbsp;in HTML and&nbsp;CSS? Like I&nbsp;understand they would look different, but&nbsp;would both be&nbsp;accomplished in&nbsp;a single HTML file or&nbsp;would it&nbsp;be 2&nbsp;separate HTML files, one&nbsp;for mobile and&nbsp;one for&nbsp;regular&nbsp;screens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s one HTML and one CSS. That’s this week’s assignment.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>W3Schools is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most helpful websites for&nbsp;CSS/HTML ever. It’s helped me&nbsp;with every single assignment and&nbsp;clarified a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;misconceptions!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use it for every single web design project I’m involved too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m curious why&nbsp;it matters if&nbsp;the pictures are&nbsp;very large, isn’t it&nbsp;better if&nbsp;it’s higher&nbsp;quality?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t want to make it bigger than it needs to be. It takes longer to download the image on the user’s computer. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I also gained experience with making my&nbsp;website adjust to&nbsp;sizing. I&nbsp;found it&nbsp;a little difficult to&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;be the&nbsp;judge of&nbsp;when a&nbsp;line was&nbsp;too long or&nbsp;too&nbsp;short.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Between 8 to 13 words is a good measure.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>One concept that remains confusing for&nbsp;the CSS&nbsp;website is&nbsp;alignment. I&nbsp;made all&nbsp;of my&nbsp;text left aligned but&nbsp;the navigation and&nbsp;logo are&nbsp;still centered. I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;looks fine that way&nbsp;but am&nbsp;unsure if&nbsp;everything needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;consistent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wouldn’t hurt.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>How familiar are&nbsp;you with wireframes and&nbsp;prototyping with Sketch and&nbsp;Figma?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m familiar with them. We use them (and Adobe XD) in GRC 429.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Shouldn’t we&nbsp;prototype on&nbsp;Figma/ Sketch before we&nbsp;go straight to&nbsp;designing&nbsp;websites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it helps you, sure. But I don’t find it helpful at all for simple websites. I find it easier to make my decisions straight with HTML and CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Talking to&nbsp;other students in&nbsp;this class is&nbsp;really helpful when I&nbsp;am stuck on&nbsp;something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s what I miss the most from not being on campus. I’ve always encouraged peer-help in my labs.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Zoom is&nbsp;a great way&nbsp;to ask&nbsp;friends for&nbsp;their opinions on&nbsp;your code and&nbsp;even to&nbsp;let them see&nbsp;your code so&nbsp;they can&nbsp;help you! One&nbsp;of my&nbsp;friends was&nbsp;on Zoom with me&nbsp;for almost an&nbsp;hour trying to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;some small issues when I&nbsp;began stylizing my&nbsp;webpages with CSS&nbsp;and I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;thankful she&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;help me! Another gave lots of&nbsp;great opinions that helped me&nbsp;adjust sizing, spacing, colors, and&nbsp;other&nbsp;elements!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Collaboration is still key! </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot&nbsp;of what we’re learning also has&nbsp;to do&nbsp;with psychology and&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;how the&nbsp;human brain works which is&nbsp;really cool! (Serial Position Effect).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! We’re always designing for humans, so we need to understand the human brain.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>In regards to&nbsp;performance load, automation can&nbsp;make a&nbsp;process faster and&nbsp;less susceptible to&nbsp;errors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s I always copy and paste names.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>My group for&nbsp;the design principles this week was&nbsp;very on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the assignment which was&nbsp;refreshing. I&nbsp;haven’t had&nbsp;a group this good in&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t always go too well. And I knew it could be the case, but I couldn’t come up with a better solution in the short amount of time we had to shift from presencial to virtual. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;explore more is&nbsp;combining my&nbsp;knowledge of&nbsp;Java and&nbsp;JavaScript with what I&nbsp;have learned about HTML/CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dina Vees will be teaching her Javascript class (GRC 452) this summer.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it&nbsp;possible we&nbsp;might not&nbsp;add anything new&nbsp;(except for&nbsp;fixing old&nbsp;mistakes) to&nbsp;the assignment this week? I&nbsp;don’t have anything using the&nbsp;float….</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely! Sometimes you don’t need media queries. Keep it simple, then.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Really enjoying this class and&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;it. All&nbsp;instructions are&nbsp;clear and&nbsp;the projects are&nbsp;fun. Officially enrolled in&nbsp;339 for&nbsp;the summer so&nbsp;I&nbsp;am definitely looking forward to&nbsp;learning more about web&nbsp;dev!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks! I see you then!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>What website have the&nbsp;best ui&nbsp;ux?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it’s hard to pick the best. But Airbnb and Spotify are two that come to my mind. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn’t related to&nbsp;the class, but&nbsp;are you&nbsp;teaching 339&nbsp;over&nbsp;summer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>And finally, I&nbsp;present to&nbsp;you a&nbsp;CSS pun&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;how I&nbsp;felt when I&nbsp;realized that the&nbsp;quarter has&nbsp;only 2&nbsp;more weeks and&nbsp;that finals are&nbsp;almost here:  </p>

<p>.fear { <br />
      display: none; <br />
}  </p>

<p>Nicky Sandoz</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I think this class is&nbsp;the perfect example of&nbsp;learn by&nbsp;doing!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks! I think so too. You struggle, you research, you make mistakes, you figure it out, you will remember.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This week, I’m finding it&nbsp;especially hard to&nbsp;stay motivated for&nbsp;school. Week 7/8 exhaustion still exists for&nbsp;online&nbsp;classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always felt like week 7 was the worst. We’re getting close to the end now.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I also read an&nbsp;article about the&nbsp;redesign of&nbsp;Kellogg’s Toucan Sam&nbsp;and it&nbsp;was not&nbsp;a good choice. Other fans were also&nbsp;outraged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw that too. But then I read someone pointing out that these mascots are designed to appeal to young children, and the new Toucan Sam is more in line with what cartoons for young children look like nowadays. </p>
