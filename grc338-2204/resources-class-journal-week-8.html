<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;8  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you&nbsp;for providing a&nbsp;great class given the&nbsp;unexpected online quarter. I&nbsp;very appreciative that you&nbsp;had so&nbsp;many office hour opportunities and&nbsp;were pretty quick to&nbsp;reply to&nbsp;emails. I&nbsp;learned a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, everybody! Grading aside, I can’t believe how easy it was to manage 60 students in this emergencial online environment!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I liked that this class has&nbsp;the same assignments due&nbsp;at the&nbsp;same day&nbsp;and time each week, some of&nbsp;my other classes were not&nbsp;like that this quarter, so&nbsp;thank&nbsp;you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I talked to teachers and students who are used to the online format, and they mentioned how helpful it is, so I knew I had to do the same. Any time I face a new problem, I do my research. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;so thankful that this class is&nbsp;asynchronous. I&nbsp;have personally found that synchronous classes are&nbsp;much harder for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;manage and&nbsp;retain information and&nbsp;cause a&nbsp;lot more stress than&nbsp;asynchronous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another point that I learned from the online education experts.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I liked that you&nbsp;said in&nbsp;the website builder video that you&nbsp;hope we&nbsp;can appreciate learning a&nbsp;skill that many thought would be&nbsp;much more difficult than it&nbsp;is. That’s exactly how&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel about learning more about HTML and&nbsp;CSS!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! Even if you don’t use them, new skills make you smarter!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Will there be&nbsp;a final exam in&nbsp;a format with questions or&nbsp;short answer&nbsp;prompts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No final exam! </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub is&nbsp;so much more easier to&nbsp;use than uploading to&nbsp;Cal Poly’s&nbsp;server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the Cal Poly’s server may be shut down at any point.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Alignment and&nbsp;centering still confuse me&nbsp;sometimes and&nbsp;take a&nbsp;while for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;figure&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Eric Meyer’s reset tool, everything is properly aligned to the left. Centering is just a hard way to make your design worse.</p>

<p>Thanks, Elle!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Some info on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;use Squarespace that I&nbsp;looked at: <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206795137-Pages-and-content-basics">https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206795137-Pages-and-content-basics</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, Abigail!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Upon looking for&nbsp;examples for&nbsp;this week’s design principles, I&nbsp;found an&nbsp;article about how&nbsp;Pinterest designed their user onboarding: <a href="https://www.appcues.com/blog/casey-winters-pinterest-user-onboarding">https://www.appcues.com/blog/casey-winters-pinterest-user-onboarding</a>. I&nbsp;explored more articles like this and&nbsp;found more interesting things about UX&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, Takumi!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Will you&nbsp;be keeping your lecture videos up&nbsp;after this course? I&nbsp;have found them super helpful and&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;reference back to&nbsp;them in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. They’re always up.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>When I&nbsp;was looking for&nbsp;final project examples, I&nbsp;found that it&nbsp;was helpful to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;good as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;bad examples. I&nbsp;definitely took note of&nbsp;what to&nbsp;avoid from the&nbsp;websites with bad&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always good to research visual language. I don’t emphasize bad design as much, but it makes sense to learn from someone else’s mistakes.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>What are&nbsp;advantages and&nbsp;disadvantages of&nbsp;using&nbsp;Squarespace?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s easier to build and maintain, but you don’t have as much control.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like I&nbsp;am learning so&nbsp;much about design principles and&nbsp;how I&nbsp;can apply them into my&nbsp;own&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only to web, right?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I think with us&nbsp;not being in&nbsp;a physical class it&nbsp;is easy to&nbsp;forget that our&nbsp;classmates are&nbsp;wonderful resources. It&nbsp;has been so&nbsp;great to&nbsp;reach out&nbsp;to classmates and&nbsp;ask questions on&nbsp;something I&nbsp;might be&nbsp;struggling&nbsp;with!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are you best resource!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m starting to&nbsp;feel like the&nbsp;terms for&nbsp;the week are&nbsp;getting intertwined. Lots of&nbsp;this weeks I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;already knew from past&nbsp;weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot of overlapping. And I appreciate how the book always lists the related principles on the bottom of each page.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Working with the&nbsp;group discussion only seems to&nbsp;be getting harder, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like we&nbsp;should all&nbsp;understand how&nbsp;to contribute by&nbsp;now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we’re done! It was expected to become harder towards the end. Maybe next time, I would stop them after six weeks.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I kind of&nbsp;miss watching the&nbsp;video compilations of&nbsp;everyone’s design principle examples. I&nbsp;remember those being available during the&nbsp;first couple weeks of&nbsp;the quarter, but&nbsp;then they eventually&nbsp;stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re still up. Last week, it went up later because of the grading. And this week’s will go up tomorrow, for the same reason. But they’re all there.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I look forward to&nbsp;taking GRC 429 with you. Are&nbsp;there any&nbsp;other UI&nbsp;UX specific prototype classes besides&nbsp;429?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the one. I look forward to working with you again too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking back at&nbsp;what we’ve learned over the&nbsp;past 8&nbsp;weeks I’m very impressed with the&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;content we&nbsp;covered, but&nbsp;more importantly, I’m impressed at&nbsp;the work we’ve done in&nbsp;building websites from scratch. I&nbsp;didn’t think I&nbsp;would ever be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;code websites in&nbsp;any ‘real’ sense, but&nbsp;now I’m excited to&nbsp;learn more! I&nbsp;just enrolled in&nbsp;Dina’s Javascript class this summer, and&nbsp;I’m looking forward to&nbsp;it. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s awesome! It’s a fun class too!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>One of&nbsp;the things most interesting about the&nbsp;assignment this week is&nbsp;really how&nbsp;much planning goes into a&nbsp;website prior to&nbsp;actually creating it. While this does seem correct, it&nbsp;also goes to&nbsp;show how&nbsp;websites should be&nbsp;modular and&nbsp;allow for&nbsp;easy modification later&nbsp;on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, websites must allow for easy modification later on.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This class was&nbsp;really fun, I&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;learn more in&nbsp;GRC 339.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s usually more fun when you code together with other students in the lab. But I’m glad you enjoyed it. Now on to GRC 339!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Web design might be&nbsp;my new&nbsp;passion. I&nbsp;have really enjoyed learning how&nbsp;to code. There is&nbsp;nothing more satisfying than figuring out&nbsp;the exact syntax to&nbsp;make your vision come to&nbsp;life. Might have picked the&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;concentration!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily. You can do whatever you want with your career, regardless of the concentration. Let me know if you need help get electives approved.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;confused how&nbsp;detailed you&nbsp;want the&nbsp;website content of&nbsp;the proposals to&nbsp;be. Do&nbsp;you want all&nbsp;the text for&nbsp;each page (similar to&nbsp;the HTML/CSS website: content hierarchy assignment), or&nbsp;just the&nbsp;beginning paragraph and&nbsp;first image of&nbsp;the&nbsp;page?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s the whole content.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>What does CMS&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Content Management System. I’m sorry I didn’t clarify it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>What kind of&nbsp;pages should we&nbsp;be including on&nbsp;our website? Or&nbsp;is that just up&nbsp;to&nbsp;us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is just up to you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>As this is&nbsp;the last journal entry, I’d like to&nbsp;thank you&nbsp;for a&nbsp;very interesting and&nbsp;engaging class during this very weird time we&nbsp;are living&nbsp;in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, everybody. Please stop by my office to say hi when we go back to campus. I’d like to meet every one of you in person.</p>
