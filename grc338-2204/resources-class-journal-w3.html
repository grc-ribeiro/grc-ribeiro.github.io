<h1>Class journal, week&nbsp;3  </h1>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Very well helped me&nbsp;also Brackets. I&nbsp;could immediately see&nbsp;what happend when a&nbsp;change was&nbsp;made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everybody! Please work on Brackets, not on GitHub. Upload your files to GitHub only when you’re ready.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Coding is&nbsp;definitely not&nbsp;a strong skill of&nbsp;mine! The&nbsp;short videos and&nbsp;topic readiness assignments have been very&nbsp;helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In baseball, they say that “natural hitters are bad teachers”. Meaning that if you never struggled with a concept, it’s harder to teach someone who is struggling. I struggled a lot with HTML when I moved from print design to web design, and I try to remember that when I’m writing assignment, making video, or writing the supporting pages.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I enjoy the&nbsp;short videos and&nbsp;quizzes. This is&nbsp;by far&nbsp;the most effective teaching I’ve&nbsp;had.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks! I’ve used them for years now and have been happy with them way before we had to move to this emergencial online state. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I was&nbsp;confused how&nbsp;to set&nbsp;up the&nbsp;CSS page this week and&nbsp;had to&nbsp;ask a&nbsp;friend again. I&nbsp;truly know almost nothing about code and&nbsp;most things we&nbsp;are doing in&nbsp;this class with the&nbsp;restaurant menu are&nbsp;new information to&nbsp;me. The&nbsp;more direction you&nbsp;can put&nbsp;on canvas, even it&nbsp;it seems very elementary to&nbsp;“spell it&nbsp;out", would be&nbsp;helpful and&nbsp;appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hear you. I’m glad a friend was able to help you, but feel free to email me. Several questions I got from students prompted me to add content either to the assignment instructions or to explanation for the mistakes to avoid. Also, it would be really helpful if everybody added their struggles in the class chat on Canvas. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>W3schools.com has&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of helpful resources! I&nbsp;explored the&nbsp;website after reading the&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments make editing and&nbsp;organization so&nbsp;much&nbsp;easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do. Use <strong>&lt;!-- insert comment --&gt;</strong> in HTML and <strong>/* insert comment */</strong> in CSS if you want to leave notes for yourself or for someone else that could eventually read your code.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>How do&nbsp;I&nbsp;italicize things without using <strong><i></strong> in&nbsp;the HTML? I&nbsp;understand how&nbsp;to implement the&nbsp;italicize and&nbsp;bold and&nbsp;span tags, but&nbsp;only with using the&nbsp;HTML. I&nbsp;don’t know how&nbsp;to submit it&nbsp;without using the&nbsp;HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use <strong>font-style: italic;</strong> in the CSS. A quick search on the web would have given you the answer.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I found that I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;how to&nbsp;style certain things. For&nbsp;example I&nbsp;kept adding different amounts of&nbsp;padding to&nbsp;align two&nbsp;elements in&nbsp;the center with each other, but&nbsp;it was&nbsp;so hard to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;exact that I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;“text-align: center” element from a&nbsp;different website that made it&nbsp;much&nbsp;easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different amounts of paddings will <strong>never</strong> make center&#8209;alignment right. Remember that each user is looking at the page on a different device, with different screen sizes. Also every designer/front&#8209;end developer constantly look things up on the web.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I still find class attributes a&nbsp;bit confusing in&nbsp;regards to&nbsp;when you&nbsp;call it&nbsp;h2.class or&nbsp;just .class, for&nbsp;example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You use <strong>h2.classname</strong> when you want to change only the <strong>h2</strong> with the specific class. When you use <strong>.classname</strong>, the style applies to any element with such class; it will be applied, for example, to <strong><h2 class="classname"></h2></strong> as well as to <strong><p class="classname"></p></strong>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>There are&nbsp;certain HTML tags that you&nbsp;can use&nbsp;that will automatically render with style on&nbsp;a browser—it’s&nbsp;probably not&nbsp;best to&nbsp;use those stylistically because you&nbsp;should do&nbsp;your styling in&nbsp;CSS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Styling belongs in the CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>What I&nbsp;found most interesting about the&nbsp;styling CSS&nbsp;part is&nbsp;that once defined rules are&nbsp;applied, for&nbsp;example for&nbsp;h1, throughout the&nbsp;entire website. This saves a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time once everything is&nbsp;well&nbsp;defined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly! That’s the point. It’s efficient and helps with consistent, so you don’t accidentally chooses a color that looks similar, but it’s not the same.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do&nbsp;we need to&nbsp;know the&nbsp;bold and&nbsp;italic tags if&nbsp;we don’t use&nbsp;them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not that you can’t use them. You may use for the right reasons, especially for calling out a specific word or phrase in a sentence. The reason you can’t use on the menu assignment is because there was no semantic reason to call out words or phrases in the menu. Therefore, all the bolds and italics would be for style, which is valid, but then should be achieved through CSS.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A topic that has&nbsp;remained confusing for&nbsp;me has&nbsp;been some of&nbsp;the github processes, I’m understanding more and&nbsp;more with the&nbsp;instruction videos - they’re very helpful, but&nbsp;the buttons and&nbsp;tools on&nbsp;the actual website are&nbsp;confusing to&nbsp;me because I&nbsp;don’t know what they mean. Buttons such as&nbsp;pull requests, commits, branches, packages, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I don’t know either. Just like Photoshop, GitHub can do much more than we initially know.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been surprising myself with how&nbsp;quickly I&nbsp;have caught onto using brackets and&nbsp;writing codes, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am still terribly confused about GitHub and&nbsp;how to&nbsp;properly link the&nbsp;CSS and&nbsp;HTML on&nbsp;there, and&nbsp;publish my&nbsp;site correctly so&nbsp;it can&nbsp;be seen. Every time I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;did it&nbsp;right, I&nbsp;get the&nbsp;404 error code- anyways I&nbsp;hope office hours on&nbsp;Monday will&nbsp;help!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope so too. And I encourage everyone to consider setting up office hours if/when they have any questions that a quick search on the web can’t answer.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>For the&nbsp;next project, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go over the&nbsp;“avoid the&nbsp;mistakes everyone makes” page before submitting my&nbsp;assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, everybody!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;continuing to&nbsp;use w3schools as&nbsp;a reference to&nbsp;explore more properties of&nbsp;what we&nbsp;are working&nbsp;on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too! Always have.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be&nbsp;nice if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;certain way&nbsp;to do&nbsp;things in&nbsp;Github (like linking the&nbsp;CSS file to&nbsp;the HTML) if&nbsp;there were step by&nbsp;step instructions or&nbsp;a video on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;do that. Especially for&nbsp;those of&nbsp;us who&nbsp;are less familiar with how&nbsp;things work in&nbsp;the coding language and&nbsp;how to&nbsp;link files together it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;confusing looking up&nbsp;how to&nbsp;do these things when there’s so&nbsp;much information online. This can&nbsp;apply to&nbsp;more complicated things in&nbsp;the future as&nbsp;well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a step&#8209;by&#8209;step for GitHub.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The “do’s” and&nbsp;“donts” for&nbsp;the labs are&nbsp;helpful too&nbsp;but since it&nbsp;is something that you&nbsp;click on&nbsp;that links to&nbsp;another page in&nbsp;the lab&nbsp;do you&nbsp;think its&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;also have those in&nbsp;a “files” tab? It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;reference back to&nbsp;the&nbsp;tips.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure if I understand, but I’ll make a standalone link on Canvas.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>There are&nbsp;many resources online to&nbsp;help further expand my&nbsp;knowledge of&nbsp;code outside of&nbsp;this&nbsp;class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Web search is extremely helpful.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t really understand why&nbsp;padding is&nbsp;necessary. I&nbsp;feel like it&nbsp;ruins the&nbsp;aesthetics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not necessary, and I tend to agree that it makes the organization of the page worse. I’d suggest using <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer’s CSS reset tool</a> to get rid of all the default margins and paddings.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A valuable resource I&nbsp;have found is&nbsp;my father who&nbsp;majored in&nbsp;computer science and&nbsp;who works currently for&nbsp;a major health company’s IT&nbsp;department. He&nbsp;has been able to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;tips for&nbsp;coding, like time management and&nbsp;troubleshooting tricks that help me&nbsp;understand coding&nbsp;better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you like to share some tips with us?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been navigating Figma and&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;become familiar with the&nbsp;program, as&nbsp;I&nbsp;will need to&nbsp;know how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;it for&nbsp;my future career in&nbsp;UX/UI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We won’t use them in this class, but it’s helpful to know Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, coding is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;staircase. If&nbsp;you miss one&nbsp;step trying to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the top&nbsp;quickly, you’ll end&nbsp;up falling off&nbsp;and having to&nbsp;start again trying to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;where you&nbsp;missed something. I&nbsp;just need to&nbsp;keep plugging away and&nbsp;writing down everything that I&nbsp;am&nbsp;learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a bad analogy. Not a bad idea for process either.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s helpful to&nbsp;all form together on&nbsp;a document and&nbsp;spill all&nbsp;of your thoughts out&nbsp;to put&nbsp;the assignment&nbsp;together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a bad idea. “To write is to think.”</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I am&nbsp;still confused about using Github and&nbsp;learning the&nbsp;different ways to&nbsp;troubleshoot when things go&nbsp;wrong, but&nbsp;running into problems encourages me&nbsp;to reach out&nbsp;and ask&nbsp;others for&nbsp;help instead of&nbsp;struggling on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do reach out to others and don’t struggle on your own.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I would appreciate it&nbsp;if you&nbsp;left specific comments as&nbsp;to why&nbsp;we didn’t get&nbsp;full points, if&nbsp;we didn’t, on&nbsp;a design example&nbsp;assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do. Every time you don’t get full points, there’s a (brief) not explaining it. Let me know if you can’t find them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Are neutral colors used more than more saturated colors in&nbsp;designing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don’t think so.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Excessive highlights will reduce the&nbsp;effectiveness of&nbsp;the&nbsp;technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned that there is&nbsp;some overlap between the&nbsp;principles we’re learning and&nbsp;sometimes it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;differentiate between two. But, you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;specific aspects of&nbsp;a design to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;which principle(s) the&nbsp;design is&nbsp;using.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to differentiate them at all. Most important is to identify the effectiveness of the design through the different lenses. It’s not a problem when principles overlap; it’s more challenging (and interesting) when different principles “pull in different directions”, requiring the designers to make more thoughtful decisions.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>If highlighting is&nbsp;applied improperly, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;ineffective and&nbsp;actually reduce performance in&nbsp;these areas. Less is&nbsp;more.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Learned what an&nbsp;entry point is&nbsp;and just how&nbsp;much we&nbsp;let them influence our&nbsp;behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it’s not a bad thing. As users/consumers, we need the landing point to mark the beginning of the experience.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>My group was&nbsp;researching the&nbsp;term “highlighting” and&nbsp;I&nbsp;found it&nbsp;interesting how&nbsp;they quantified highlighting by&nbsp;saying it&nbsp;could only be&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;the design. If&nbsp;it was&nbsp;more than it&nbsp;would lose its&nbsp;effect and&nbsp;get&nbsp;diluted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is more a general rule than a specific quantified measurement. Just keep in mind that any additional highlighting diminishes the effectiveness of highlighting on the other elements.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Getting everybody to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;discussions doesn’t seem to&nbsp;be too&nbsp;bad because everybody is&nbsp;contributing, but&nbsp;we’re all&nbsp;providing out&nbsp;own examples and&nbsp;sometimes it’s hard to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;a conclusion on&nbsp;which one&nbsp;we want to&nbsp;use for&nbsp;our write&nbsp;up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not necessary for everybody to provide their own examples, though. But if they do, it’s not necessarily bad either. You can always ask for my feedback if there’s a tie. If you have something by Wednesday at noon,&nbsp;I’ll be happy to take a look and give you feedback before you submit your example. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I took a&nbsp;deep look into entry point in&nbsp;design which I&nbsp;really had&nbsp;never thought&nbsp;about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studying design principles will that that to you.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>The discussion assignment this week helped me&nbsp;think more about&nbsp;design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the goal, of course. I was very aware that online discussions were not ideal, but I couldn’t let them go. </p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>When I&nbsp;submitted the&nbsp;design principles and&nbsp;then resubmitted after fixing an&nbsp;error, I&nbsp;could not&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;delete the&nbsp;previous submission(s), so&nbsp;our group ended up&nbsp;with 3&nbsp;different versions&nbsp;posted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s ok.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Why code your own&nbsp;website when we&nbsp;can use&nbsp;squarespace or&nbsp;other pre-made&nbsp;sites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s an excellent question, that I won’t have time to answer now, but we will talk about it in a few weeks.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I finally learned how&nbsp;to take a&nbsp;good screenshot this week and&nbsp;it made me&nbsp;happy! I&nbsp;really appreciate the&nbsp;updated, in-depth&nbsp;explanation.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we&nbsp;could benefit from an&nbsp;hour synchronous class session where everyone can&nbsp;ask questions pertaining to&nbsp;the coding assignment and&nbsp;where you’re able to&nbsp;answer them all&nbsp;at once. This would be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;other students as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;they will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;learn from others’ issues and&nbsp;solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can’t have synchronous class session in a asynchronous class. And nobody wants to be online for an hour waiting for their time to ask a question. Please post your questions in the journal, send me an email, or set up office hours appointments. It’s more efficient and effective for everybody if I broadcast the questions and answers for everybody. For example, it takes me roughly two hours to read and answer this page with every week. I wouldn’t take me that long in a synchronous class, but that’s not the best use of <em>your</em> time.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m trying really hard to&nbsp;form a&nbsp;schedule to&nbsp;get all&nbsp;of my&nbsp;school work done. I’m so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;working around my&nbsp;classes schedule that it’s kind of&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;manage all&nbsp;this time that I&nbsp;have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do. We need schedules.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Will we&nbsp;ever look at&nbsp;poor designs? Or&nbsp;design improvement using the&nbsp;principles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not. I don’t like to show bad design. But if I find that the comparison between poorly implemented solutions and effective design is helpful, I may show them.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Also learned how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;the new&nbsp;Schedule Builder that Cal&nbsp;Poly is&nbsp;implementing. With all&nbsp;these new&nbsp;online classes and&nbsp;technologies, there’s a&nbsp;steep&nbsp;learning curve because the&nbsp;softwares are&nbsp;new&nbsp;for a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;professors/students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know. There was some unfortunate timeline to launch the new schedule builder. It’s nobody’s fault, but it adds up to, well, everything we’re dealing with.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>When does a&nbsp;joke become a&nbsp;dad joke?</p>

<p>When it&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;apparent.</p>

<p>(Stephanie Tang)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this joke.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Why are&nbsp;fish so&nbsp;smart - because they live in&nbsp;schools :D.</p>

<p>(Rita Yu)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>A good way&nbsp;to remember the&nbsp;order for&nbsp;margins and&nbsp;padding is&nbsp;thinking of&nbsp;the word trouble (TRBL).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never heard that one. I prefer the visual of the clock, but maybe “TRBL” will be more effective to someone.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Note for&nbsp;the homies that are&nbsp;struggling with the&nbsp;“good” screenshots: make sure you’re not&nbsp;in full&nbsp;screen!</p>

<p>You got it!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>This class is&nbsp;a good balance of&nbsp;frustrating and&nbsp;fun&nbsp;lol.</p>

<p>I know what you mean.</p>
