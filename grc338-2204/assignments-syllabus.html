<h1>Course expectations  </h1>

<h2>Attendance  </h2>

<p>You are&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;be in&nbsp;class ready to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the scheduled time. Class&nbsp;starts at&nbsp;1:40. Arriving late and/or leaving early will count as&nbsp;½&nbsp;absence. </p>

<p>Labs also contain lecture material, and&nbsp;you are&nbsp;accountable for&nbsp;the material presented in&nbsp;labs. Don&rsquo;t leave early unless you&nbsp;have made arrangements with me&nbsp;to do&nbsp;so. Arriving late and/or leaving early will count as&nbsp;½&nbsp;absence. There will be&nbsp;questions on&nbsp;the midterm and&nbsp;final exams that can&nbsp;only be&nbsp;answered from information presented in&nbsp;labs.</p>

<p>After two&nbsp;absences in lecture or lab, each&nbsp;½&nbsp;absence will result in&nbsp;less 1% of&nbsp;the final grade. If&nbsp;you are&nbsp;sick and&nbsp;can&rsquo;t attend our&nbsp;class meeting, however, please stay&nbsp;home. </p>

<p>If you&nbsp;miss a&nbsp;lecture or&nbsp;lab, you&nbsp;are fully responsible for&nbsp;getting that information. Exams cannot be&nbsp;taken early or&nbsp;late, only at&nbsp;the allowed time unless you&nbsp;provide documentation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;disability during the&nbsp;first two&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;class. Late lab&nbsp;work is&nbsp;not&nbsp;accepted.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;case of&nbsp;extenuating circumstances, such as&nbsp;an ongoing illness or&nbsp;the death of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loved&nbsp;one, the&nbsp;professor should be&nbsp;consulted as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible, and&nbsp;documentation from a&nbsp;doctor may&nbsp;be required. In&nbsp;such circumstances the&nbsp;faculty and&nbsp;student can&nbsp;negotiate the&nbsp;possibility of&nbsp;granting an&nbsp;&ldquo;Incomplete.&rdquo; In&nbsp;the rare cases where a&nbsp;student is&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;take an&nbsp;&ldquo;Incomplete&rdquo; as&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;extenuating circumstances, the&nbsp;student must follow the&nbsp;guidelines and&nbsp;timelines stipulated in&nbsp;the University&nbsp;catalog.</p>

<h2>Lab protocol  </h2>

<p>During the lab hours, you must work on the assignment for the week. If you finish your assignment earlier, you are encouraged to help other students. In the field of design it is important that you are able to share and discuss yours and others&rsquo; ideas. You may discuss solutions with a colleague, as long as each one of you is working on a different solution for the assignment. Helping others will make you grow as a designer, I&nbsp;promise.</p>

<p>If music makes you more productive, you are encouraged to bring some headphones for&nbsp;the&nbsp;labs. <strong>Do not play music through speakers.</strong> Also, do not play loud music on&nbsp;your headphones; it bothers other students and will prevent you from hearing the&nbsp;instructor.</p>

<h2>Email communication  </h2>

<p>Please note that I only respond to emails that are professionally written, with correct spelling, and&nbsp;addressed properly. Though we are a pretty casual group in this department, please don&rsquo;t address your professors by last name only, because this is rude. I would prefer that you call me by my name, which is Bruno. Or, if you prefer the more formal approach, please call me Mr.&nbsp;Ribeiro or Professor Ribeiro, but again, mind the spelling. </p>

<p>I will make every effort to respond to your email with 24 hours during the week, but I don&rsquo;t usually respond to emails on weekends. Also, I don&rsquo;t do critique, review, lecture, or any other content exchange through email. Email communication must be short and address policies, requirements, deadlines, or other logistic related issues. </p>

<h2>Office hours  </h2>

<p>My office hours are listed on the top of this document. I encourage you to use them if you need more instruction beyond the lectures and labs. You should, however, be prepared with specific questions. Explain what efforts you have made to investigate the topic. Bring your notes from lectures and other material to help me understand what your needs are.  </p>

<h1>Evaluation  </h1>

<p>The assignments will be evaluated on their technical execution, quality of the visual language, and effectiveness of the solution. A&nbsp;100-point scale will be applied to&nbsp;all&nbsp;assignments, with different weights, as indicated on&nbsp;Canvas. A&nbsp;20-point penalty will be automatically applied to late work. Another 20-point penalty will be applied every 24&nbsp;hours after&nbsp;the&nbsp;original due time.</p>

<h2>Assignments  </h2>

<h3>Design principles: 25%</h3>

<p>For the first seven weeks of class, a group activity will be held in class covering different design principles. The groups will be assigned in class. Each student is expected to come prepared to discuss all the principles with their group. In the end of the class, students will be evaluated by their group members. You will not be allowed to submit it later; if you miss class, you get a zero for the activity of the day. In the end of the quarter, you will discard your lowest two grades for these activities.</p>

<h3>Topic readiness: 10%</h3>

<p>For the first seven weeks of class, a lesson will be posted on Canvas for the topic that&nbsp;we&nbsp;will&nbsp;be covering in the lab. Before your lab session, you need to go through the&nbsp;assigned lessons and do a quick quiz, to test if your ready for your lab session. You will not be allowed to submit it later, except&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;rare cases&nbsp;of extenuating circumstances. Make sure to plan ahead.</p>

<h3>HTML / CSS: 10%</h3>

<p>For the first five weeks of lab, we will be working on weekly assignments to exercise the&nbsp;concepts covered in the Canvas lessons.</p>

<h3>Website redesign: 10%</h3>

<p>The first big project for this course is a redesign of a website. Instructions&nbsp;and&nbsp;interim deadlines will&nbsp;be&nbsp;provided on Canvas and on the class website.</p>

<h3>Final project: 10%</h3>

<p>The final project for this course is a website built using a content management system. Instructions&nbsp;and&nbsp;interim deadlines will be provided on Canvas and on the class website.</p>

<h3>Midterm exam: 10%</h3>

<p>HTML/CSS</p>

<h3>Final exam: 15%</h3>

<p>HTML/CSS and design principles</p>

<h3>Class journal: 10%</h3>

<p>At the end of every week of class, you write a brief journal entry on Canvas. It&nbsp;should not take you more than five minutes, though. I will start every week by sharing with the class the highlights from the journal entries. Even though I will be able to know who wrote each entry, this information won&rsquo;t be shared with class, and the entries will be shared anonymously. (Unless you submit a joke; jokes will be shared with credit to the student who submitted them.)</p>

<h2>Grade scale  </h2>

<p>&lt;&lt;[gradescale.html] </p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no round up of grades or extra credits. Please don&rsquo;t ask.</strong></p>

<h2>Plagiarism and originality  </h2>

<p>Please make sure the work you do for this courseis original in nature and not a revised version of something you were working on in another course. Dishonesty, cheating, deception, or plagiarism is not acceptable. Unless otherwise stated and&nbsp;referenced in &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; copyright guidelines, it is expected that all design work be original work of the student. <strong>Revising any existing work created by another person or student is plagiarism. Revising any existing work created from another course is plagiarism. Copying existing code from any source into your project is plagiarism, unless it is clearly authorized by the instructor of the class. Inspiration code needs to be properly cited, with author(s) and source.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions about academic integrity in relation to your work in this course, make sure to discuss them with me and/ or consult the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR). <strong>Plagiarism and cheating may result in expulsion from Cal&nbsp;Poly and&nbsp;every university in the CSU system</strong>.</p>
