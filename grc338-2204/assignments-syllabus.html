<h1>Readings  </h1>

<h2>Required book  </h2>

<p>Lidwell, William, et al. <em>Universal Principles of Design: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design</em>. University of Simon Fraser Library, 2013. <a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/calpoly/reader.action?docID=3399678">The book can be read online for free through the Cal&nbsp;Poly library</a>.</p>

<p>Additional online articles will be assigned on the <a href="https://grc-ribeiro.github.io/grc338-2204/readings.html">class website</a>.</p>

<h1>Course expectations  </h1>

<h2>Attendance  </h2>

<p>The class is being held asynchronously, that means we don&rsquo;t have a particular time to meet during the week. You are, however, expected to being engaged with the class during the week. Please check Canvas for all the deadlines. On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, the discussion for the design principle assignment will be open. Your participation is required.</p>

<h2>Email communication  </h2>

<p>Please note that I only respond to emails that are professionally written, with correct spelling, and&nbsp;addressed properly. Though we are a pretty casual group in this department, please don&rsquo;t address your professors by last name only, because this is rude. I would prefer that you call me by my name, which is Bruno. Or, if you prefer the more formal approach, please call me Mr.&nbsp;Ribeiro or Professor Ribeiro, but again, mind the spelling. </p>

<p>I will make every effort to respond to your email within 24 hours during the week, but I don&rsquo;t usually respond to emails on weekends. Also, I don&rsquo;t do critique, review, lecture, or any other content exchange through email. Email communication must be short and address policies, requirements, deadlines, or other logistic related issues. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can send me a message through Canvas, but keep it short and professional as email.</p>

<h2>Office hours  </h2>

<p>Since I can&rsquo;t hold office hours in my office during this quarter, I&rsquo;ll be available for office hours from Monday to Friday for two hours in the morning (from 9:00am to 11am) and two hours in the afternoon (from 1:30 to 3:30). You can schedule on Canvas twenty-minute Zoom appointments with me and up to two more students. (Go to <code>Calendar</code> and click on the <code>Find Appointment</code> button.) I encourage you to use them if you need more instruction beyond the lectures and labs. You should, however, be prepared with specific questions. Explain what efforts you have made to investigate the topic. Bring your notes and help me understand what your needs are.</p>

<p>In case you need a private appointment, just let me know when you sign up for the appointment, and I&rsquo;ll block the time just for you.</p>

<h1>Evaluation  </h1>

<p>The assignments will be evaluated on their technical execution, quality of the visual language, and effectiveness of the solution. A&nbsp;100-point scale will be applied to&nbsp;all&nbsp;assignments, with different weights, as indicated on&nbsp;Canvas. A&nbsp;20-point penalty will be automatically applied to late work. Another 20-point penalty will be applied every 24&nbsp;hours after&nbsp;the&nbsp;original due time.</p>

<h2>Assignments  </h2>

<h3>Design principles: 25%</h3>

<p>For the first eight weeks of class, a group activity will be held in class covering different design principles. The groups will be assigned in class. Each student is expected to come prepared to discuss all the principles with their group. In the end of the class, students will be evaluated by their group members. You will not be allowed to submit it later; if you miss class, you get a zero for the activity of the day. In the end of the quarter, you will discard your lowest two grades for these activities.</p>

<h3>Topic readiness: 10%</h3>

<p>For the first seven weeks of class, a lesson will be posted on Canvas for the topic that&nbsp;we&nbsp;will&nbsp;be covering in the lab. Before your lab session, you need to go through the&nbsp;assigned lessons and do a quick quiz, to test if your ready for your lab session. You will not be allowed to submit it later, except&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;rare cases&nbsp;of extenuating circumstances. Make sure to plan ahead.</p>

<h3>HTML / CSS: 10%</h3>

<p>For the first five weeks of lab, we will be working on weekly assignments to exercise the&nbsp;concepts covered in the Canvas lessons.</p>

<h3>Website redesign: 10%</h3>

<p>The first big project for this course is a redesign of a website. Instructions&nbsp;and&nbsp;interim deadlines will&nbsp;be&nbsp;provided on Canvas and on the class website.</p>

<h3>Final project: 10%</h3>

<p>The final project for this course is a website built using a content management system. Instructions&nbsp;and&nbsp;interim deadlines will be provided on Canvas and on the class website.</p>

<h3>Midterm exam: 10%</h3>

<p>HTML/CSS</p>

<h3>Final exam: 15%</h3>

<p>HTML/CSS and design principles</p>

<h3>Class journal: 10%</h3>

<p>At the end of every week of class, you write a brief journal entry on Canvas. It&nbsp;should not take you more than five minutes, though. I will start every week by sharing with the class the highlights from the journal entries. Even though I will be able to know who wrote each entry, this information won&rsquo;t be shared with class, and the entries will be shared anonymously. (Unless you submit a joke; jokes will be shared with credit to the student who submitted them.)</p>

<h2>Grade scale  </h2>

<p>&lt;&lt;[gradescale.html] </p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no round up of grades or extra credits. Please don&rsquo;t ask.</strong></p>
