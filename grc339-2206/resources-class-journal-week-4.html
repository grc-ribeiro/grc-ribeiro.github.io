<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Would it&nbsp;be possible to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;speaking sections in&nbsp;the tutorial videos louder? I&nbsp;have found they are&nbsp;much quieter than every other video / type of&nbsp;media I&nbsp;play on&nbsp;my&nbsp;computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I didn’t know! Had I known, I would have fix it for the other videos.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Definitely have a&nbsp;love/hate relationship with webdev. I&nbsp;find it&nbsp;super fun, but&nbsp;it does take a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;experimentation before I&nbsp;can create a&nbsp;product I&nbsp;like. I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;get too&nbsp;zoned in&nbsp;when I&nbsp;work on&nbsp;these projects (since I&nbsp;enjoy them) which always causes some sort of&nbsp;issue in&nbsp;my code that I&nbsp;get stuck on&nbsp;for a&nbsp;while. Other than that, I&nbsp;think its&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, it’s super fun but only after hours of frustration trying to make it work to finally realized that you forgot a semicolon or that <code>dispay:flex</code> is not the same as <code>display:flex</code>.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I came to&nbsp;realize that when sharing one&nbsp;CSS with a&nbsp;website with multiple pages, some attributes you’ve applied on&nbsp;one page will effect what you&nbsp;have previously done. Classes have to&nbsp;be applied to&nbsp;fix it&nbsp;up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct. That’s why classes exist, to differentiate elements with same hierarchy but different styles.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Something that kind of&nbsp;confuses me&nbsp;is using classes inside sections versus divs. When would I&nbsp;use divs instead of&nbsp;sections?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">The difference is semantic. In HTML5, several tags such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,  <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and  <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, were introduced. They work just as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but for more specific uses.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">From the (excellent) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">MDN web docs</a>: </p>

<p  class="classjournal">“Each<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element) as a child of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element. Do not use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element as a generic container; this is what <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is for, especially when the sectioning is only for styling purposes. A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear in the outline of a document.” </p>

<p  class="classjournal">Makes sense?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I have found that an&nbsp;easier way&nbsp;to upload to&nbsp;Github is&nbsp;to put&nbsp;all my&nbsp;HTML, CSS, and&nbsp;image files into a&nbsp;folder on&nbsp;my desktop, name the&nbsp;folder the&nbsp;correct name for&nbsp;the project, go&nbsp;to Github and&nbsp;click into my&nbsp;grc339 folder, hit&nbsp;the upload files button, and&nbsp;drag my&nbsp;folder in&nbsp;from my&nbsp;desktop. I&nbsp;have preferred this method over making a&nbsp;new blank index.html in&nbsp;Github.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I have tried that once, and it didn’t work. Maybe it was on the browser I was working on. Anyway, I use the GitHub Desktop app or (way more often) the command line.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The photo gallery was&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;challenging to&nbsp;get right because a&nbsp;little bit&nbsp;of change would cause it&nbsp;to completely crash&nbsp;sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">You can always undo, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;padding-bottom on&nbsp;main, the&nbsp;percentage in&nbsp;the calculation is&nbsp;not 72% by&nbsp;default. The&nbsp;calculation for&nbsp;padding-bottom on&nbsp;main needs to&nbsp;be because of&nbsp;the ratio on&nbsp;the&nbsp;photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Correct. height/width for the percentage, then add 3em or 4em for the captions.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Is there any&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;photo gallery responsive in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;pushing the&nbsp;nav of&nbsp;the gallery down when a&nbsp;larger image is&nbsp;displayed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes. You can, for example, use flexbox or you can change the size based on the input that’s checked… There are different ways, but none is that trivial.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It has&nbsp;also been helpful for&nbsp;me to&nbsp;look around at&nbsp;other websites I&nbsp;visit for&nbsp;ideas on&nbsp;topics/layout, especially differences between mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always, always, always look for reference. I can’t emphasize this enough.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I truly learned the&nbsp;value of&nbsp;having an&nbsp;organized code this week. Looking through (my own) chaotic code was&nbsp;the most frustrating experience, thank you&nbsp;for reminding me&nbsp;of the&nbsp;code formatting websites upon my&nbsp;first submission, I&nbsp;will never forget to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;and will certainly use&nbsp;it more&nbsp;frequently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It really helps. Also, pay attention to the color code on Brackets (or any text editor that you use).</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I’m curious to&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;photo gallery navigation bar&nbsp;when it&nbsp;has arrow keys at&nbsp;the left and&nbsp;right ends of&nbsp;the&nbsp;bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I can’t think of any solution that doesn’t require JavaScript. I&nbsp;hope I’m wrong, though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>It’s good to&nbsp;double or&nbsp;even triple check your work in&nbsp;the code. I&nbsp;almost forgot about putting a&nbsp;proper title in&nbsp;the&nbsp;header.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes triple&#8209;check for the win!</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;very glad we&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;work with a&nbsp;partner on&nbsp;the final&nbsp;project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Sometimes it really helps to work with someone you can share your doubts and brainstorm solutions together.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>One skill I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;learn in&nbsp;the future is&nbsp;how to&nbsp;implement an&nbsp;image carousel on&nbsp;the home page of&nbsp;a site. I&nbsp;feel like now&nbsp;that I&nbsp;know how&nbsp;to make a&nbsp;gallery, I’m closer to&nbsp;being able to&nbsp;add this kind of&nbsp;feature to&nbsp;a&nbsp;site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please check this website first: <a href="http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/">Should I Use A Carousel?</a></p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I feel like I’ve learned SO&nbsp;many valuable things from things from taking these web&nbsp;classes! Also recommend CSC&nbsp;484 for&nbsp;anyone who&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;learn more about the&nbsp;process of&nbsp;user centered interface design. I&nbsp;took the&nbsp;class last quarter and&nbsp;it really helped to&nbsp;reinforce the&nbsp;concepts we&nbsp;learned in&nbsp;GRC&nbsp;338.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I don’t know much about this class, but it does sound interesting. You&nbsp;should also take GRC&nbsp;429 with me in the fall.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Do you&nbsp;have any&nbsp;recommendations on&nbsp;the best way&nbsp;to display our&nbsp;websites in&nbsp;our&nbsp;portfolios?</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Nice screenshots should do it. But you can add link to the actual pages on GitHub too.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I also can’t believe it’s the&nbsp;last week of&nbsp;this class! I&nbsp;still want to&nbsp;learn&nbsp;more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Please don’t stop learning just because we’re done with this class. You know <a href="https://css-tricks.com/guides/">CSS Tricks</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>, and <a href="https://mdn.dev">MDN</a> already. Don’t forget that you have access LinkedIn Learn (previously Lynda.com) through&nbsp;Cal&nbsp;Poly.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I really enjoyed this class! It&nbsp;was super fast but&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;learned a&nbsp;lot about grid and&nbsp;flexbox and&nbsp;can definitely see&nbsp;myself using it&nbsp;in the&nbsp;future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’ve enjoyed it too. I hope I can eventually meet all of you that I only had as an online student.</p>
