<h1>Welcome to&nbsp;GRC&nbsp;339  </h1>

<h2>Class overview  </h2>

<p>The class will be <strong>asynchronous</strong>, which means that we don’t have a certain time to meet. But, it’s not really self-paced, since there are <strong>several deadlines per week</strong>. So keep checking Canvas. And stay on top of your work.</p>

<p>Since we can’t meet in my office or in class, I’ll hold virtual office hours every day, for three hours in the afternoon. I’ll make sure to inform you when I have to change them.</p>

<p>And you won’t be able to come to my office or find me in the GrC resource room, but you can always email me.</p>

<p>No required book, but I may suggest readings and online video.</p>

<h2>Assignments  </h2>

<p>Quizzes are due on Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>Assignments due on Thursdays and the following Monday.</p>

<h2>Canvas  </h2>

<p>When you get to Canvas, you will see that it’s organized by week. </p>

<p>Every week, a quiz that’s due on Tuesday, but you really should do it on Monday, when it’s open. And another quiz that is open on Thursday and due on Friday.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, there’s an HTML/CSS assignment that’s due on the following Thursday. And another HTML/CSS assignment opens on Thursday and it’s due on the following Monday.</p>

<p>You can see all the due dates on the right hand column.</p>

<p>You can also view the class calendar, where you have all the assignment due dates.</p>

<p>If you click on Calendar feed, you can add this calendar to your phone or computer, or integrate it with Google Calendar, for example.</p>

<p>The Calendar is also where you can reserve a slot for <strong>virtual office hours</strong>, in case there’s something you want to address and you think it’ll work better talking than with email. Choose the slot that works best for you, and, when it’s time, you follow the link to the Zoom meeting. Try to reserve them with at least a few hours in advance. </p>

<h2>Syllabus  </h2>

<p>There’s a link to the Syllabus on Canvas navigation. Please read the syllabus carefully and let me know if you have any question.</p>
