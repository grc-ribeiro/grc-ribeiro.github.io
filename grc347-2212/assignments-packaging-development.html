<h1>Packaging development  </h1>

<p>Based on your visual ideations and spacial explorations, develop at least three digital options for <strong>one product</strong>  of your line of products. </p>

<p>At this point, the “mockups” will be very crude. You don’t need to make them realistic. You want to communicate the idea for how the packaging/label will be.</p>

<p>Some of you have made the decision on what shape and visual language to use. Some of you have not. Either way, I&nbsp;<em>encourage</em> you to set up an <a href="https://calendly.com/bruno-ribeiro/office-hours" target="_blank">appointment</a> with me during my office hours so we can discuss your ideas. Even more effective and fun is to set the appointment with more than one student, but neither is a requirement.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<p>Check rubric for evaluation criteria. </p>

<p>(If you don’t see a rubric, please let me know as soon as possible.)</p>

<hr />

<h2>Submission  </h2>

<ol>
<li>A three&#8209;page, letter-size, portrait PDF, in order of preference from your favorite to your third favorite.</li>
</ol>

<p>Submit your <strong>PDF</strong> to Canvas <strong>Thursday,&nbsp;18&nbsp;February&nbsp;2021, at&nbsp;11:59pm</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Peer-review  </h2>

<p>For this assignment, I’ll be using the Canvas’s peer&#8209;review tool for the first time (ever). Each of will be assigned to five reviews. <strong>They’re not required or graded.</strong> You’ll be doing it voluntarily to help your peers. </p>

<p>If we were in the labs, you’ll be in groups giving each other feedback, but since it’s not possible, I’d&nbsp;like to see you all helping each other. I&nbsp;know that many of you miss it too.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>don’t use the rubric</strong>. Just leave comments stating:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What’s your favorite and why.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestions for improvements.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Peer&#8209;reviews are loosely due on <strong>Monday,&nbsp;22&nbsp;February&nbsp;2021, at&nbsp;11:59pm</strong>. But since they’re not required, it’s better late than never.</p>
