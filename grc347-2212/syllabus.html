<p><em>Additional online articles will be&nbsp;assigned on&nbsp;the <a href="https://grc-ribeiro.github.io/grc347-2212/readings.html" target="_blank">class&nbsp;website</a>.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Course&nbsp;expectations  </strong></h3>

<p>The class is&nbsp;being held asynchronously, which means we&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;particular time to&nbsp;meet during the&nbsp;week. You&nbsp;are, however, expected to&nbsp;be engaged with the&nbsp;class during the&nbsp;week. Please check Canvas for&nbsp;all the&nbsp;deadlines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Email&nbsp;communication  </strong></h3>

<p>Please note that I&nbsp;only respond to&nbsp;emails that are&nbsp;professionally written, with correct spelling, and&nbsp;addressed properly. Though we&nbsp;are a&nbsp;pretty casual group in&nbsp;this department, please don’t address your professors by&nbsp;the&nbsp;last name only, because this is&nbsp;rude. I&nbsp;would prefer that you&nbsp;call me&nbsp;by my&nbsp;name, which is&nbsp;<strong>Bruno</strong>. Or, if&nbsp;you prefer the&nbsp;more formal approach, please call me&nbsp;<strong>Mr.&nbsp;Ribeiro</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Professor Ribeiro</strong>, but&nbsp;again, mind the&nbsp;spelling. </p>

<p>I will make every effort to&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;your email within 24&nbsp;hours during the&nbsp;week, but&nbsp;I don’t usually respond to&nbsp;emails on&nbsp;weekends. Also, I&nbsp;usually don’t do&nbsp;critique or review through email, but since this class has been moved to an emergency remote environment, I am more than happy to answer any question you have through email. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you&nbsp;can send me&nbsp;a message through Canvas too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Office&nbsp;hours  </strong></h3>

<p>Since I&nbsp;can’t hold office hours in&nbsp;my office during this quarter, I’ll be&nbsp;available for&nbsp;office hours from Monday to&nbsp;Friday from 2:00 pm&nbsp;to 5:00 pm. You&nbsp;can schedule on&nbsp;Calendly twenty‑minute Zoom appointments with me&nbsp;and up&nbsp;to two&nbsp;more students. I&nbsp;encourage you&nbsp;to use&nbsp;them if&nbsp;you need more instruction beyond the&nbsp;videos and&nbsp;instructions. You&nbsp;should, however, be&nbsp;prepared with specific questions. Explain what efforts you&nbsp;have made to&nbsp;investigate the&nbsp;topic. Bring your notes and&nbsp;help me&nbsp;understand what your needs&nbsp;are.</p>

<p>Again, email or messages through Canvas can work too. (Sometimes even better.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Evaluation  </strong></h3>

<p>A&nbsp;100&#8209;point scale will be&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;all&nbsp;assignments, with different weights, as&nbsp;indicated on&nbsp;Canvas. A&nbsp;20&#8209;point penalty will be&nbsp;automatically applied to&nbsp;late work. Another 20&#8209;point penalty will be&nbsp;applied every 24&nbsp;hours after&nbsp;the&nbsp;original due&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Assignments  </strong></h3>

<p><strong>Quizzes:&nbsp;20%</strong> <br />
Every week, a quiz covering the content of the lecture will be assigned on Canvas. You are expected to take the quiz before you start working on your assignment for the week. You&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be allowed to&nbsp;submit it&nbsp;later, except&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;rare cases&nbsp;of extenuating circumstances. Make sure to&nbsp;plan&nbsp;ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging design:&nbsp;60%</strong> <br />
A ten-week project will be assigned in the beginning of the quarter. Every week, there will be a different deliverable as part of the design process.</p>

<p><strong>Final exam: 10%</strong> <br />
During finals week, an online final exam will cover the content of the lectures. The exam is asynchronous with open book. Feel free to research as much as you need and even take in collaboration with another student.</p>

<p><strong>Class journal:&nbsp;10%</strong> <br />
At the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;every week of&nbsp;class, you&nbsp;write a&nbsp;brief journal entry on&nbsp;Canvas. It&nbsp;should not&nbsp;take you&nbsp;more than five minutes, though. I&nbsp;will start every week by&nbsp;sharing with the&nbsp;class the&nbsp;highlights from the&nbsp;journal entries. Even though I&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;know who&nbsp;wrote each entry, this information won’t be&nbsp;shared with class, and&nbsp;the entries will be&nbsp;shared anonymously. (Unless you&nbsp;submit a&nbsp;joke; jokes will be&nbsp;shared with credit to&nbsp;the student who&nbsp;submitted&nbsp;them.)</p>
