<h1>Brand comparison and&nbsp;visual references  </h1>

<p>As part of the process, you will look for visual references to compare with your brand. This will help you define and articulate your brand voice. It will also help you avoid staring at a blank screen and be more intentional in your design choices in the next weeks.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Tasks  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with brands in other industries that “speak” the visual language that you want to apply to your brand. (Think: “If my brand was a car, it would be…”, “If it was a restaurant…”)</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the search with non-branded images with the appropriate look-and-feel of your brand. (Design, art, anything really. Refer to this week’s lecture.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use Pinterest or a similar service to <em>collect</em> the images.  </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Although Pinterest is great for <em>collecting</em> images, it is <em>awful</em> tool for searching for images. Do not use Pinterest to look for your images. Find better sources and upload them to Pinterest yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the images to make a cohesive collection. Include somewhere from 30 to 80 images on your board. (Still no penalty for doing more as long as still a cohesive collection.)</p></li>
<li><p>In the submission comments, include three to eight words that you would associate with your brand voice. But don’t use only words directly related to the product such as “healthy” or “performance”, you want to include some words that are more subjectively related to your brand.</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven’t decided between two brand voices, let me know in the comments.  </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<p>Check rubric for evaluation criteria. </p>

<p>(If you don’t see a rubric, please let me know as soon as possible.)</p>

<p><strong>A common mistake</strong> is failing to explore your mood board beyond package or ads for products in your category.</p>

<p><strong>Another common mistake</strong> is&nbsp;to include images that are&nbsp;too disconnected to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;collection.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Submission  </h2>

<p>Submit the <strong>link</strong> to your image board until <strong>Thursday,&nbsp;14&nbsp;January&nbsp;2021, at&nbsp;11:59pm</strong>.</p>
