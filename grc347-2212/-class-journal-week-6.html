<p  class="classjournal">€€ 46 Sustainability ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>If environmental packaging is&nbsp;a good concern now, why&nbsp;haven’t many companies made&nbsp;changes?</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Money.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 42 Packaging ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>Does multiple colors make packaging more&nbsp;costly?</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ You tell me. Didn’t you do your research? (They usually do cost more.)</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 05 Last assignment ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>The material research was&nbsp;also a&nbsp;good review from FSN&nbsp;354 and&nbsp;how food and&nbsp;packaging work&nbsp;together.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Looks like you know way more about packaging than I do.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 22 Design principles ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>I really like to&nbsp;see the&nbsp;“form follows function” principle when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;architecture. I&nbsp;think that the&nbsp;most beautiful buildings are&nbsp;the ones where each design component has&nbsp;a practical function, and&nbsp;then those components are&nbsp;put together&nbsp;aesthetically.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ I enjoy architecture examples too. I wich I knew more about architecture, though.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 10 IxD ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>The mental model is&nbsp;so important for&nbsp;the products and&nbsp;services that we&nbsp;use today. It’s easy to&nbsp;subconsciously become frustrated when using an&nbsp;application that just doesn’t flow well because it&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;do things differently than other programs that we&nbsp;have become used to. It’s really impressive when innovative technology is&nbsp;released that users can&nbsp;learn how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;without becoming&nbsp;frustrated.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Apple is one that progressively trains us for some interactions before they become essential to using the product.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 05 Last assignment ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>I really enjoyed the&nbsp;assignment this week; I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;had an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;what my&nbsp;product would look like, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;found myself going outside the&nbsp;box. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good&nbsp;time.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ I enjoyed reading about the different solutions you all have researched and presented.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 13 Design process ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>The middle of&nbsp;the quarter always brings back some bad&nbsp;procrastination habits for&nbsp;me; I&nbsp;really want to&nbsp;break that for&nbsp;the sake of&nbsp;meaningful classes like this&nbsp;one.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Week 7 is the hardest, but you can power through it!</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 42 Packaging ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>Some unique shapes for&nbsp;packaging can&nbsp;be really cool and&nbsp;eye-catching, but&nbsp;costly to&nbsp;make since it&nbsp;may require a&nbsp;whole new&nbsp;process.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ To design is to make decisions.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">€€ 22 Design principles ¥¥</p>

<p  class="classjournal"><em>Keep in&nbsp;mind people’s mental models and&nbsp;expectations when thinking of&nbsp;shapes for&nbsp;packaging.</em></p>

<p  class="classjournal">^ Yes. But also keep in mind that sometimes it’s beneficial to break those mental models. To design is to make decisions.</p>
