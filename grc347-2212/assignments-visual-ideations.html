<h1>Visual ideations  </h1>

<p>Based on your research and visual references develop at least three digital options for <strong>one product</strong>  of your line of products. </p>

<hr />

<h2>Tasks  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Watch the videos on visual representation (last week) and visual identity (this week).</p></li>
<li><p>From the visual identity, develop at least eight different layouts. </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to use at least three different visual representation styles and at least three different categories from the logo taxonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>Make them quick, though. You don’t need to spend more than 10&nbsp;minutes on each idea. </p></li>
<li><p>Choose two or three ideas to develop a little more.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There’s no penalty for doing more! You want your ideas to be as different as possible. Explore different concepts, rather than different executions for the same concept. You don’t need to be constrained by physical attributes, yet. Think of a label, the front of a box, a view of a round tin, etc. The goal is to develop a visual identity rather than being too concerned with the specifics of applying to the package. </p>

<hr />

<h2>Evaluation  </h2>

<p>Check rubric for evaluation criteria. </p>

<p>(If you don’t see a rubric, please let me know as soon as possible.)</p>

<hr />

<h2>Submission  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a multi-page, letter-size, landscape PDF.</p></li>
<li><p>On the first page, place your favorite logos (the ones you developed more).</p></li>
<li><p>On the following pages, place the other ideas. Include captions as necessary. e.g.: “Light-and-shadow/Metaphorical”.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Submit your <strong>PDF</strong> to Canvas <strong>Thursday,&nbsp;4&nbsp;February&nbsp;2021, at&nbsp;11:59pm</strong>.</p>
