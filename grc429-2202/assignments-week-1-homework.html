<h1>Homework (week 1)  </h1>

<p>In this course, you will work for 10 weeks on the same project. In groups of two students, you will create a new product that uses <a href="https://www.google.com/search?augmented+reality">augmented reality</a> to help someone do their job. This person will have one of the following&nbsp;jobs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bus driver  </li>
<li>Firefighter  </li>
<li>K&ndash;12 teacher  </li>
<li>Librarian  </li>
<li>Nurse</li>
</ol>

<p>For this first week, each group needs to choose a first and a second choice from the list above. Then write <strong>two paragraphs for each choice</strong> answering the following&nbsp;questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Besides convenience, why did you choose that person&rsquo;s job to help?</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of convenience, how do you plan to have access to people that have that job? (You&rsquo;ll need to interview five or six of them.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Submit your ideas on <strong>Canvas</strong> (as plain text) by <strong>Friday, 10&nbsp;January&nbsp;2020, at&nbsp;11:55pm</strong>.</p>
