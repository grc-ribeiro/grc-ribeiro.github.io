<h1>Grade breakdown  </h1>

<h3>Project documentation: 60% ###</h3>

<p>Every week&mdash;from week 2 to finals week&mdash; you will be required to bring an updated version of&nbsp;your report. On finals week, you will also deliver a final presentation on the day of our finals. Those are the only assignments for this class. Your report will be graded weekly, and in each week the grade will receive a greater weight.</p>

<h3>Midterm exam: 12%</h3>

<p>Design process</p>

<h3>Final exam: 15%</h3>

<p>Design process and design principles</p>

<h3>Class journal: 10% ###</h3>

<p>At the end of every week of class, you need to write a brief journal entry on PolyLearn. It&nbsp;should not take you more than five minutes, though. I will start every week by sharing with the class the highlights from the journal entries. Even though I will be able to know who wrote each entry, this information won&rsquo;t be shared with class, and the entries will be shared anonymously. (Unless you submit a joke; jokes will be shared with credit to the student who submitted them.)</p>
