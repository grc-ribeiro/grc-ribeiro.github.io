<h5 class="classheader"><a href="index.html">GRC 339</a>: <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a></h5>

<h1>Digital magazine proposal  </h1>

<p>For this assignment, you need to create a website for a news publication. This publication has a specific focus rather than broad general news or even topics such as fashion, sports, or music. Think specific genre of fashion or music, or maybe a specific league or even a team.</p>

<p>Examples of focus for the publication:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vegetable home growing  </li>
<li>Young women in business  </li>
<li>American street art  </li>
<li>Underground hip hop  </li>
<li>NBA  </li>
<li>Manchester United  </li>
<li>Bird watchers  </li>
<li>Calligraphy and lettering  </li>
<li>etc., etc., etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please, don’t limit yourself to the options above. They were just <em>examples</em>.</p>

<p>You can work in groups of one or two students.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Brand voice and reference board  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with brands in other industries that “speak” the visual language that you want to apply to your brand. (Think: “If my brand was a car, it would be…”, “If it was a restaurant…”)</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the search with non-branded images with the appropriate look-and-feel of your brand. (Design, art, anything really. Refer to this week’s lecture.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use Pinterest or a similar service to <em>collect</em> the images.  </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Although Pinterest is great for <em>collecting</em> images, it is <em>awful</em> tool for searching for images. Do not use Pinterest to look for your images. Find better sources and upload them to Pinterest yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the images to make a cohesive collection. Include somewhere from 30 to 80 images on your board. (There’s no penalty for doing more as long as still a cohesive collection.)</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Tasks  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Write an introduction of your magazine, with its name and its focus.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose three to eight words that you would associate with your brand voice. But don’t use only words directly related to the product such as “vegetable” or “basketball”, you want to include some words that are more subjectively related to your brand.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a preliminary color palette on <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">Coolors</a>, <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/" target="_blank">Adobe Color</a>, or similar service with shareable links for specific palettes.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose two or three type families from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe Fonts</a> for your publication.</p></li>
<li><p>Download this [template][tp] and populate with the content of your proposal.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Groups  </h2>

<p>This assignment was designed to be an individual project. But since some of you are already collaborating with another student, I want to encourage you keep collaborating. Therefore, you may <strong>choose</strong> between <strong>groups of one or two students</strong>. But there are two simple rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you choose to go solo, don’t complain of the amount of work. The assignment was designed to be accomplished by one person.</p></li>
<li><p>If you choose to work with someone else, don’t complain about your teammate not working as much as you are. The assignment was designed to be accomplished by one person, and the choice of working with someone else is yours.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Submission  </h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to your <code>grc339/digital-magazine-proposal/</code> folder in your public repository on GitHub.&nbsp;<a href="resources-github-pages-tutorial.html#Publishing-your-work-on-GitHub-Pages">➤</a></p></li>
<li><p>Upload your HTML file to your GitHub repository.&nbsp;<a href="resources-github-pages-tutorial.html#Publishing-your-work-on-GitHub-Pages">➤</a></p></li>
<li><p>Click on <a href="links-digital-magazine-proposal.html" target="_blank">your name</a> to check if it’s working.</p></li>
<li><p>If it’s working, submit to Canvas the emoji that best represent your magazine.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>(If you’re working in&nbsp;a group of&nbsp;two, one&nbsp;student of&nbsp;the group submits the&nbsp;proposal, while the&nbsp;other submits a&nbsp;<a href="★">redirect&nbsp;file</a> to&nbsp;their teammate’s&nbsp;proposal. Both submit an&nbsp;emoji to&nbsp;Canvas.)</em> </p>
