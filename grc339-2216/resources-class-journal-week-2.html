  <p>I am&nbsp;still enjoying how&nbsp;well you&nbsp;structure your asynchronous classes, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;cannot wait to&nbsp;be back in&nbsp;a class room and&nbsp;to finally meet you&nbsp;in&nbsp;person!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I am&nbsp;too very happy with how&nbsp;my classes have been structured, but&nbsp;I also look forward to&nbsp;being back in&nbsp;the building. There are&nbsp;students who&nbsp;graduated in&nbsp;spring that took three or&nbsp;four classes with me&nbsp;and I&nbsp;never met&nbsp;them. That makes me&nbsp;sad.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Office hours was&nbsp;super helpful and&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;remember to&nbsp;take full advantage of&nbsp;that time if&nbsp;I&nbsp;am struggling or&nbsp;didn’t do&nbsp;as well on&nbsp;an assignment as&nbsp;I’d wanted&nbsp;to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Always! <a href="https://calendly.com/bruno-ribeiro/office-hours" target="_blank">Please do!</a></p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The way&nbsp;these assignments are&nbsp;set up&nbsp;is a&nbsp;great learning technique. I&nbsp;find I&nbsp;am able to&nbsp;test out&nbsp;different numbers and&nbsp;scenarios while seeing how&nbsp;it was&nbsp;built without the&nbsp;stress of&nbsp;messing everything up. It&nbsp;is kind of&nbsp;like working backwards and&nbsp;dissecting the&nbsp;file to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;how we&nbsp;want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Since we&nbsp;don’t have the&nbsp;lab to&nbsp;have help from each other, I&nbsp;figured these files would be&nbsp;more efficient to&nbsp;avoid mistakes that are&nbsp;not necessarily related to&nbsp;the&nbsp;assignment.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>The quiz that I&nbsp;took on&nbsp;Monday was&nbsp;pretty difficult. I&nbsp;wasn’t able to&nbsp;grasp the&nbsp;concept as&nbsp;easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s supposed to&nbsp;be challenging, so&nbsp;you can&nbsp;learn from&nbsp;it.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I understand why&nbsp;you like Firefox so&nbsp;much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It’s that I&nbsp;<em>like</em> it&nbsp;so much. But&nbsp;it has&nbsp;the tools that we&nbsp;<em>need</em> for&nbsp;web&nbsp;development.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>For the&nbsp;photo gallery quiz, I&nbsp;enjoyed the&nbsp;open invitation to&nbsp;google the&nbsp;information if&nbsp;we did&nbsp;not catch it&nbsp;in the&nbsp;video. I&nbsp;don’t think I&nbsp;could confidently remember how&nbsp;to do&nbsp;everything I&nbsp;have learned in&nbsp;past classes from memory perfectly, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am confident that once my&nbsp;memory is&nbsp;jogged I&nbsp;could do&nbsp;almost anything I&nbsp;had done once&nbsp;before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m always looking things&nbsp;up.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I learned a&nbsp;lot more about flexbox this week. Its&nbsp;becoming one&nbsp;of my&nbsp;favorite new&nbsp;topics.</p>

<p  class="classjournal">Please share with us&nbsp;if you&nbsp;find something we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;know&nbsp;too.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>W3Schools is&nbsp;such a&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">It sure is. But&nbsp;recently I’ve been using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web" target="_blank">MDN Web&nbsp;Docs</a> more often than <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></p>

  <p>It was&nbsp;really cool to&nbsp;learn that creating a&nbsp;form in&nbsp;HTML and&nbsp;CSS isn’t too&nbsp;hard!</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Creating the&nbsp;form is&nbsp;not that hard. Getting the&nbsp;data and&nbsp;compiling the&nbsp;results would take few&nbsp;extra steps,&nbsp;though.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I am&nbsp;just a&nbsp;little confused why&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;give the&nbsp;target figure full opacity we&nbsp;put <code>opacity: 1</code>&nbsp;under this part of&nbsp;the code: <br />
    <code>input:nth-of-type(1):checked ~ main figure:nth-of-type(1), <br />
    input:nth-of-type(2):checked ~ main figure:nth-of-type(2), <br />
    input:nth-of-type(3):checked ~ main figure:nth-of-type(3){</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Let’s start with the tilde (<code>~</code>), which has the fancy name of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator" target="_blank">general sibling combinator</a>. Its general syntax is: <code>former_element ~ target_element { style properties }</code>. What it does is, it applies the properties to the <em>target_element</em>, but “only if it follows the first element (though not necessarily immediately), and both are children of the same parent element”. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
In our case, the <em>former_element</em> is <code>input:nth-of-type(n):checked</code> and the <em>target_element</em> is <code>main figure:nth-of-type(n)</code>. So the properties will be applied to <code>main figure:nth-of-type(n)</code>, but only if it follows <code>input:nth-of-type(n):checked</code>. Therefore, it’ll be applied to a <code>figure</code> element if it follows an <code>input</code> element. But, in our case, it will not be applied to any <code>figure</code> element following any <code>input</code> element; specific <code>figure</code> elements following any <code>input</code> elements. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
Both the <em>former_element</em> and the <em>target_element</em> of our example have the <code>:nth-of-type()</code>  pseudo-class. When we write <code>input:nth-of-type(1)</code>, it means the first of the <code>input</code> element in a specific parent element; while <code>main figure:nth-of-type(1)</code> means the first <code>figure</code> that is inside a <code>main</code> element in a specific element. Well, in our example, all of our <code>figure</code> elements are inside a <code>main</code> element and they all follow all the <code>input</code> elements. Let’s say we wrote the we wrote the following selector: <br />
    &nbsp;  </p>

<pre class="wrongcode"><code>input:nth-of-type(1) ~ main figure:nth-of-type(1),  
input:nth-of-type(2) ~ main figure:nth-of-type(2),  
input:nth-of-type(3) ~ main figure:nth-of-type(3),  
input:nth-of-type(4) ~ main figure:nth-of-type(4){  
}
</code></pre>
<p  class="classjournal">The properties would be applied to the first, second, third, and fourth <code>main figure</code> elements, because they all follow all the <code>input</code>. It would have been a very complicated way to write <code>main figure{ }</code>, because the properties would be applied to all the <code>main figure</code> elements that we have in our specific page. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
When we attach the <code>:checked</code> pseudo-class to the <code>input</code> element, we make sure that the <code>main figure:nth-of-type(1)</code> will be targeted only when <code>input:nth-of-type(1)</code> is checked. In other words, the properties will be applied to the first <code>figure</code> element only if it follows the first <code>input</code> element <em>and</em> that first <code>input</code> element is selected (checked). We have already established that the first <code>figure</code> follows the first <code>input</code> element, because, in our HTML, all the <code>input</code> elements come before the <code>figure</code> elements. Our <code>input:nth-of-type(n):checked  ~ main figure:nth-of-type(n)</code> works as a conditional statement then: we only apply the properties to the nth <code>figure</code> if the nth <code>input</code> is checked. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
Then come the properties, or in our case, comes the property, singular, because we only have one. (But I did have two properties in the video.) Since we had applied <code>opacity: 0</code> to all <code>main figure</code>, which makes them invisible, I have to make them back to full opaque by applying the <code>opacity: 1</code> property to the first image if the first radio-button is selected or to the second image if the second radio-button is selected and so on. <br />
    &nbsp; <br />
For completeness, I want to remind you that the radio buttons are still in the page even if we made them invisible with the rule set <code>input {display: none;}</code>. Also, in our example page’s <code>nav</code>, the thumbnail images are not really controlling the main images in the gallery; each thumbnail is a <code>label</code> for the <code>input</code> with the matching <code>id</code>. The hidden inputs, then, are the ones controlling the opacity of the main images in the gallery.</p>

  <p>I didn’t know that you&nbsp;could do&nbsp;different transitions so&nbsp;easily, it&nbsp;stressed me&nbsp;out at&nbsp;first but&nbsp;once you&nbsp;know, you&nbsp;know and&nbsp;I&nbsp;kept playing around, even if&nbsp;they are&nbsp;minuscule&nbsp;differences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Yes, transitions in CSS are rather cool. And <a href="https://www.eamesoffice.com/blog/the-details-are-not-the-details/" target="_blank">working the details is what makes the design</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>I still slightly confused when you&nbsp;would use&nbsp;“left” in&nbsp;CSS. I&nbsp;understand that it&nbsp;makes the&nbsp;element move to&nbsp;the right, however, we&nbsp;didn’t use&nbsp;it in&nbsp;CSS gallery activity so&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t fully grasp&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">That’s what it does, it moves positioned elements to the right, but has no effect on non-positioned elements. From the excellent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>: “for absolutely positioned elements, the distance to the left edge of the containing block; for relatively positioned elements, the distance that the element is moved to the right of its normal position.”</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Unlike Photoshop or&nbsp;Illustrator, where 100% is&nbsp;full opacity, the&nbsp;opacity property has&nbsp;a value of&nbsp;either 0&nbsp;(full transparency) or&nbsp;1 (no transparency).</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">Is it that unlike, though? Isn’t 100% equal to the whole (1)?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="classjournal">
  <p>Recently, I&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;take an&nbsp;opportunity that involved some HTML and&nbsp;CSS knowledge. I&nbsp;credit GRC&nbsp;338 and&nbsp;this class for&nbsp;allowing me&nbsp;to confidently say&nbsp;that I’m at&nbsp;least proficient in&nbsp;these coding&nbsp;languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p  class="classjournal">I’m sure they helped, but&nbsp;I credit <em>you</em>&nbsp;for taking charge of&nbsp;your growth and&nbsp;not being afraid of&nbsp;learning something&nbsp;new.</p>
